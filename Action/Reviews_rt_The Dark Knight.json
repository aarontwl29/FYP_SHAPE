Christian Bale plays a perfect playboy billionaire. If you never watch another super hero movie ever...just watch this one."

It’s not just a thrilling showdown between Batman and the chaotic, unpredictable Joker, but a profound exploration of justice, morality, and sacrifice. With its gripping plot, relentless tension, and Heath Ledger’s unforgettable performance as the Joker, The Dark Knight stands as more than just an action film — it’s a haunting reflection on the darkness within human nature. This is one of those rare movies that stays with you long after the credits roll."

Nolan went away from what Begins did and did something entirely different which normally doesn't work but this one did and did beautifully. His moment in time and shoulda won him Best Director. TO be there in 2008 was something special. Despite all the economic issues and everything, to experience this movie and all the Ledger fandom in the summer of 2008 was something special. Heath broke all of us in the best way that year and it was beautiful. Damn I miss him. Masterpiece."

    "review": "*The Dark Knight* (2008) shatters the notion that Tim Burton’s 1989 *Batman* is untouchable, delivering a gritty, modern masterpiece that redefines the franchise. Christian Bale’s Batman, with his raspy, tough-guy voice—occasionally humorous but fiercely intense—soars as Gotham’s protector. However, it’s Heath Ledger’s haunting, unhinged Joker that steals the show, a chaotic anarchist with no clear origin, radiating menace whether wielding a knife or reveling in deranged glee. His performance, underscored by an unsettling, almost broken hair-dryer-like tension, cements him as the film’s unforgettable core. Unlike the traditional Joker, who often emerges from a vat of chemicals, Ledger’s version is a mysterious force of anarchy, making every scene he’s in electric and unpredictable. The film’s pacing falters slightly with the introduction of Two-Face, whose arc, while compelling, doesn’t match the Joker’s gripping intensity. Still, Aaron Eckhart’s portrayal of Harvey Dent’s tragic fall adds depth to the story, even if it feels less captivating. Directed by Christopher Nolan, *The Dark Knight* blends stunning visuals, a taut narrative, and profound themes of morality and chaos, making it not just the best Batman film but a cinematic landmark. Ledger’s iconic, Oscar-worthy performance ensures the Joker’s legacy endures, while the film’s thrilling conclusion solidifies its place as a near-perfect send-off. It’s a rare sequel that outshines its predecessors in every way."

    "review": "The dark knight, directed by Christopher Nolan is one of the most successful comic book movies of all the time that does not only involve a drama where there are a villian and a hero, but also includes layers of politics, philosophy, and sociology. This action/crime/thriller movie is mostly known for the great acting of Heath Ledger as if it wouldn't be a big succsess without him. However, I think there are many things that have helped the movie to be one of the greatest, consisting of Form, Colors, a strong plot, and so on. As a case in point, Joker's jacket comes in purple color which is a metaphor for disorder, confusion and desolation. In addition, the ending scene is very likely to be the best all-time ending of the comic book movies - especially when it comes to the last frame, where the dark knight enters the tunnel following a great sign of light, it is as though he has finally fulfilled his destiny and has entered dawn from darkness. I don't see any extra characters in the movie, and each of them has been played well by their actor, especially the fabulous acting of Heath Ledger which was a revolution by itself. At the same time, however, the replacement choice of Katie Holmes with Maggie Gyllenhaal didn't help the chemistry between Bruce and Rachelle and it rather left an alien space for us. Dialogues have made a remarkable achievement to be historical and commercial. Such dialogues could be \"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain\" and \"Why so serious?\" There are drawbacks to the movie. Firstly, I have always said that Nolan is not very good at taking action shots and for that what we are shown are rather not decent and seems confusing because of breaking the 180* rule and numerous cuts while characters have engaged in fighting. Secondly, we could have seen more of Harvey Dent's dark side so that there would be enough reasons that could justify why he became 'Two-face', and there was a bit rush in the rythm of Two-face screen-time comparing to the other events happening at the same time. All in all, the film is of a great quality - one of the top notches that must be seen carefully. I would recommend it to those who look forward for something new, questionable, and dramatic rather a pure element of entertainment."

In my view, this is not only the pinnacle of superhero cinema but also a contender for one of the top two or three films ever made. Critics who disagree often seem to misjudge what distinguishes exceptional filmmaking. From its stunning visuals and gripping action to its masterful mise-en-scène, impeccable casting, and stellar performances, every element is executed with precision. Christopher Nolan proves himself a visionary, elevating the superhero genre to unparalleled heights—his return to it would be a gift to audiences. Christian Bale’s portrayal is pitch-perfect, cementing him as a generational talent. I find myself rewatching this film time and again, captivated by its enduring brilliance."

    "review": "A film that takes its stakes too seriously to the point that it’s susceptible to unintended laughter and developed bloat. Where Batman Begins gifted us an innocuous and sweet origin story, The Dark Knight is an example of continuously erasing the classic feel of Batman & Gotham by creating a modern-day/post-9/11 feel for its city (which is clearly Chicago). It was noticeable that Batman Begins had retained some of its atmosphere, and it’s arguably toppled by its solid story. TDK has a subsided world building, filler locations, weaker editing (hospital explosion was…), and a weaker and less cohesive story. TDK also suffers from its unnatural dialogue exchanges; Ledger puts up an admirable and historic performance (who relatively stands out due to Nolan’s infamous writing and familiar casting to many of his characters) and so does Gary Oldman (which is also no surprise). The dialogue between Bale and Ledger is distant; you don’t get much of the sense or idea that these two are pure rivals and were meant to tango to the end. The gritty nature Gotham is given no doubt leaves it as an unsafe location, where danger is lurking at every corner. But the issue is power-scaling. The Joker seems to have power at will, and is presented as if he has every nation’s military at his disposal. Theoretically, with his power, there shouldn’t be anyone to match him as a threat due to his global connections and over-the-top negotiation tactics, especially with how inept in strength Gotham civilians are, so it only leaves an even greater responsibility for Batman and Co. But the lackluster execution is simple: Ledger’s Joker doesn’t fit in the world of Nolan’s Batman, as he lacks writing purpose and subtlety. Many other things to talk about — how did that bus crash through that window going up the stairs in reverse? The Joker must’ve hired the GREATEST automobile expert in human history. So many plot holes in such a prolonged run-time with such a cop-out ending."

THE GOOD: the second half of the movie is phenomenal, the greatest Batman movie is in this second half. Heath Ledgers performance is the most stunning thing ever. He molded himself into the joker. Two face is good but not great I feel he was killed and off to quick but I get it. The action scenes are much better. Idk what it is but Batman’s voice in this is way better than in Batman Begins for some reason. The pacing and score is phenomenal that can not go unsaid. THE BAD: what happened to scarecrow? He was in the first 10 minutes then just disappeared. Batman’s suit is absolutely terrible and he looks like a toy. I said the greatest Batman move of all time is in the second half right? Well the first half is not quite there, it’s good but it is a lot of setup that was really unnecessary. Joker is being set up this whole time as being this insane character which is good but it goes on too long, we know he’s insane already. Two-Face is hardly in the movie really. The pacing of the first half is not great, it is too slow, it feels like I am watching Zack Snyders Justice league which is almost double the length of this movie. TAKEAWAY: The dark Knight is highly overrated. Not because it’s bad but because it’s really good. It is not the best comic book movie ever, it is not even top 3. Best thing of the movie is 🃏 no doubt and u know why."

The storytelling is gripping, the action sequences are breathtaking, and Hans Zimmer’s score is electrifying.

Batman is a rich guy who protects the upper class, while Joker seems to be more for the average worker than Batman is. Though this is fairly obvious enough that it’s a common argument for why people love Joker. Perhaps that’s intended, but the villain is much more likable than our “hero” here."

It has absolutely everything, great story, terrific acting with an out of this world performance from the late Heath Ledger and brilliant set pieces. This is the perfect movie for me and will never get tired watching it. Aaron Eckharts performance is criminally underrated and I think gives the film much heart. Bale as expected knocks it out of the park and takes a backward step to let Ledger showcase his talent. This is the Jokers film. Nolan is a master and this still is his masterpiece. Cannot fault anything in this film. Editing is top notch too. The film never felt long, due to the excellent editing. The score was out of this world. Main themes are quite deep here. Deep rooted corruption, politics, organised crime and how it controls and affects a city. These are quite relevant today and the film has not aged extremely well."

    "review": "With \"Batman Begins\", we delved deep into establishing what and who the batman as a symbol is to a failing city like Gotham. In \"The Dark Knight\", we get to see those ideas truly tested at the highest degree. And no one was more perfect for the task than Heath Ledger's Joker. This idea of the joker being almost a symbol in itself for batman is exactly what this sequel needed. At face value, you can look at the joker as just the kind of man the underbelly of Gotham needs to stand behind and fight against this power struggle for the city. But if you look deeper, this joker can almost be seen as a physical embodiment of Gotham's current form, testing the batman. An entity of necessary force of evil to help the batman grow and a shape him as the symbol that Gotham needs. In this film, we see the batman face the same struggles that set him back many times in the first film, except this time, the consequences are more dire. Letting his personal matters cloud his judgement, fighting the urge to become what he set out to fight against, what it takes to be a symbol and the burdens that come with it. And against these trials the joker sets out for him, we see how \"the batman\" isn't enough for a creature like Gotham. For this beast can only be tamed by a Dark Knight. So many iconic scenes that really still hit just as good as seeing them for the first time. If you're anything like me and found it difficult to praise this movie so highly as others do the first time around, you really have to change your approach. In the past, I really was only watching it casually as a common superhero film. But to really enjoy this Christopher Nolan trilogy, you have to be fully locked-in and invested in what's going on and why what's happening matters. While the fun scenes are really a treat to watch, the real meat of entertainment is in the writing and the meaning of the story. The thought-provoking questions, the moral dilemmas, the journey of doing what's necessary. Bundling up that with a theatrical spectacle, is really what makes this trilogy and particularly this installment, so great. Rest in peace Heath Ledger."

Heath Ledger's portrayal as the Joker might be one of the single best character portrayal's in the history of films. I also really love how this film is part of a trilogy, yet it still could work as a standalone film. Well done everyone!"

The plot was very suspense, where it kept me guessing about what would happen next, in a time where i basically guess what's going to happen next in the movie just using my gut and get it correct. Not gonna lie, almost every actor, including every minor actor, did their job right. Christian Bale showcases so far the best act as Batman, Heath Ledger is easily the best joker, and one of the most prolific super villainy acts in a superhero movie. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent was a 10/10 casting, as he was arguably the star for me the whole film. Other castings such as Michael Caine as Alfred and Morgen Freeman as Lucius were spot on. Well I wish i could have seen more of what Christopher Nolan could have done with the DC Multiverse, in fact, in my opinion, if he did, the DC multiverse would have been in a much better position right now."

Yes Heath Ledger is good as The Joker but is he better than Gary Oldman in this movie? I would call it an honourable draw. It is a good movie but not a great one and I also think that Maggie Gyllenhaal is miscast."

Mas eu realmente gosto da escolha técnica e visual! Olha, eu gosto de encontrar falhas em filmes, sempre encontro, mas esse Batman é diferente, e a história do filme é muito boa, por exemplo a cena na prisão, um dos melhores debates entre Batman x Coringa, as coisas que o Coringa fala: \"Essa sociedade civilizada, quando não precisar mais de você, vai te jogar fora, para eles, você é só um louco\" Coringa :) Que filme, que final magistral, esse filme termina em alta, com uma trilha sonora fantástica, talvez um pequeno problema menor, e a parte da coreografia da luta!

I think it goes without saying that the best thing about the film is how Heath Ledger interpreted the Joker, among other things that make the film EXCELLENT, such as the soundtrack (it is simply beautiful, very good composer Hanz Simmer), the development of the story It has a lot of suspense, adrenaline, action; Christian Bale here looks more imposing than in the previous film as Batman, the design of Two-Face is great (it doesn't matter, but it's great) and the ending seems like a good closing to me; Some complained because Two-Face died, they say that Nolan did not give the character as much respect, but the truth is that, if Two-Face had not died, the third film would not have any meaning. That is, the death of Harvey Dent (Two-Face) is what greatly affects the reputation of Batman and later Gordon. So, even though it hurts, Two-Face's death was worth it. In addition, his participation was great while it was difficult. Because just when you think the movie is going to end, BAM!!! Two Faces arrives to extend it a little more with the last act of the film, which is very well done, it is a very tense scene. In the end, the movie has a crazy man, the mafia, a night watchman who has gained the trust of the police, a corrupt hero (Harvey Dent/Two-Face), among other VERY interesting and well-developed characters. 100% recommendable."

Few films in history have ever even come close to matching it's quality and excellence. Every time someone names a list of their top five or top ten favorite movies, it is safe to say that the dark knight will almost always be in 3 or above. No matter how many times I watch it, looking for just one weakness, I come up short. It does everything perfectly. It never ceases to bring my heart rate up, never ceases to keep me constantly invested in the movie at every second. The only other Batman film that comes even close to scratching this one's level is 2022's \"The Batman\", another one of my top 5 place holders for my favorite movies. If you like action, superheroes, grizzly thrillers, suspense, this movie will have everything you're looking for. It pulls no punches on establishing the Joker as a truly depraved individual who will do anything to prove his point. It makes it very clear that Batman isn't really the hero, because \"He's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs.\" Also, this is DEFINITELY not for kids. I think that is pretty clear. I've watched this movie frequently since I first saw it in 2021, (Still can't believe I took that long to watch it) and I plan to watch it for as long as I live. This is Nolan's best work, his magnum opus, and might be the absolute pinnacle of film."

The atmosphere is so powerful, the motorcycle scenes are breathtaking, the overall attention to detail is and I'm crying right now during the scene where Rachel and Harvey are talking to each other strapped to the bombs. The acting doesn't miss a beat. Just fucking wow. Although this sequel is more epic, I actually think Batman Begins is a better and more concise movie. The second half of this movie ran a little long and all over the place in my opinion. That being said, this is still one of the greatest movies of all time, I have repeat watched it more than almost any other movie, and I still remember the feel of watching this in theaters with my cousins--10 minutes in and I realized I was viewing something epic. It somehow accomplishes a sleek, yet gritty feel and atmosphere at the same time. A true masterpiece of cinematography. Also William Fichtner is a distant cousin of mine so that's kind of cool."

First of all, the dark tone feels earned and it never once feels like it's trying to be edgy on purpose. It has amazing messages about good and evil, and has so d amazing scenes (prisoner throwing the detonator out the window, Two faces final confrontation, every scene with Joker) and some amazing quotes (this world just showed you that it's full of people ready to believe in good). Joker is such a god-tier character, to the point where I would say he's the performance in any movie ever. Watch it. Even if you hate batman this movie will change your mind."

Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhard, Morgan Freeman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal are all perfect. Heath Ledger is something more. I'll have a paragraph only about him. Christopher Nolan creates this dark atmosphere in the movie within the characters and their actions. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, with one of the smartest uses of light I've ever seen. The score is also amazing and super exiting (specially in the last scene). The story is driven by the Joker. And only the Joker. The Joker is everything. He is amazing (still not talking about Heath Ledger). He changes the political and social scenario in Gotham and owns it, as he does the movie. Every plot point, every dilemma, everything, comes back to him. Bruce is also amazing in the movie and Christian Bale brings it again. He is amazing as this character. His personality, his interactions (mostly with Alfred - Michael Caine is also spectacular! He is Alfred). His relationship with the Joker is incredible and the interrogation scene… damn… The themes this movie explores are dense and deep. It talks about trauma, justice, doing what is necessary, symbolism, and just like Batman Begins talked about the thin line between justice and vengeance, The Dark Knight talks about the thin line between good and evil / harmony and chaos, and how to go from one side to the other, \"it only takes a little push.\" The last scene is outstanding and shows how Bruce is willing to sacrifice as long as it means the people in Gotham believe/hope for a better future. If there is anything, tiny bit, negative here is that it may get a bit convoluted from the 2nd to 3rd act, but that will probably be resolved in a (guaranteed) rewatch. Now, the following is me expressing my love for Heath Ledger's Joker: He is chaos. He is evil. He is trauma. He is everything corrupted about the world. He is amazing. Heath Ledger encarned one of the greatest characters of all time and delivered one of the best performances of all time. Every millisecond of mannerism. Every expression. Every word in every line of dialogue. Every body movement. Everything. Is. Perfection. This is truly an achievement in acting that should be studied. Ledger is one of the greatest losses in the history of cinema… I heard everything about how The Dark Knight is one of the goat movies, and I know many people that regard it as the goat, so my expectations were sky high before the film. And it didn't disappoint. It really deserves its reputation. This movie is an exploration of good and evil like I've never seen before. It's a remarkable achievement by one of the greats, Christopher Nolan. And it will go down as one of the greatest comic book movies of all time, showing that they can be something more."

The acting is fantastic, every character is likable, the cinematography is gorgeous, the music is incredible, the action is amazing, and the writing and story are some of the most engaging in any movie! This film has been analyzed and nitpicked to death, and though those opinions are valid, it doesn't diminish how outstanding this movie is! This truly is one of the greatest sequels ever made!

    "review": "The Dark Knight - 10/10. Christopher Nolan's legendary sequel to his genre changing reboot Batman Begins is literally the best example of how to continue on a story. The Dark Knight offers audiences the greatest comic book film that has ever been made. With riveting performances from Christian Bale, Anthony Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhall, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and of course, the Academy Award Winning performance of Heath Ledger, TDK dives you into the dark and cold world of Gotham. Nolan creates a Gotham that looks like its out of a page from Michael Mann's production notes. The city plays almost like a character to the dedicated vigilante of Batman. Unlike previous iterations, the Batman faces foes in this film that more than just evil. The Joker is literally a prankster anarchist, with no regards for whatever action they make. Two-Face is a fallen antihero who falls down the broken path as he loses the love of his life and also sees how corruption rots the city from within. Then there are the gangsters who run amuck in the city, and this all is covered so expertly by Nolan throughout the film. The way he makes a superhero feel real, and also make it seem believable is astonishing. The Dark Knight was the first time watching a super hero movie where I felt, the explanations and the treatment made it real world. Its one of the reasons why it works so so well! And the political undertones and commentary are just perfect, commenting on real life situations and using the famous DC characters to showcase and explain the rights and wrongs of these thought processes. All in all, a legendary film that all should watch, regardless if you're a super hero film lover or not."

    "review": "The Dark Knight is in reality, just what the public often views it as; an excellent movie demonstrating some of the best writing and framing in Christopher Nolan's arsenal of films. Throughout the many times I have viewed this film, my yearning for a more developed, sequel-appropriate design for Christian Bale's Batman is almost completely forgotten in the shadow of excellent framing, screenwriting, and the stellar performance by Heath Ledger as The Joker. These aspects of the movie in particular should be an example to other productions of how to set up and create a true villain, without neglecting the other characters. Elements of the plot and story come together nicely at the end, making for a compelling, action-filled sequel. My only gripe with this film is the extremely unfortunate choice to recast Katie Holmes' amazing performance as Rachel Dawes. However, this \"choice\" occurred mostly by force given Holmes' independent decision to pursue other opportunities, so the directors cannot be blamed in this regard."

Nothing is predictable with the Joker and the movie lets it be known from the beginning with that scene of the bank robbery."

The grounded story has yet to be matched by the big budget Marvel Universe, which tends to lean overly into cgi, while Nolan keeps 'The Dark Knight' very focused on the characters' within the relatable setting. The movie ultimately loses points due to the anticlimactic ending, though the consideration of some mitigating circumstances were of import to consider."

No tiene más nota porque el principio de la película se me hace un poco pesado y quizá la trama de Singapur si no recuerdo mal se me hace un poco aburrida. Este Joker es un antes y un después en la historia cinematográfica de Batman, después de tanto tiempo dándole un toque patético e infantil al joker, se decide dar un toque más oscuro y respetable al villano el cual la gente no confiaba que Heath Ledger fuese a estar a la altura, y lo superó con creces siendo el mejor Joker hasta el momento y con diferencia, de hecho el Joker de la nueva película parece una copia de Ledger."

    "review": "\"Batman: The Dark Knight\" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that redefines the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, combined with an impeccable cast, propels this film to unparalleled heights. Unafraid to delve into the darkest corners of the human psyche, \"The Dark Knight\" emerges as a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of heroism, morality, and the fine line between good and evil. Christian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, delivers a nuanced and deeply compelling performance. His portrayal strikes the perfect balance between the tormented billionaire and the caped crusader, grappling with the moral dilemmas that come with wielding immense power. Bale's conviction in his role makes him the definitive Batman for a generation. Heath Ledger's posthumous portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. The late actor's performance is an unsettling tour de force, transcending the boundaries of comic book villains. Ledger's Joker is chaotic, unpredictable, and utterly mesmerizing—leaving an indelible mark on the genre and setting an impossibly high standard for all future portrayals of the character. The film's supporting cast further enriches the narrative. Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon brings a grounded and steadfast presence to Gotham's police force, while Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent evolves from a charismatic, idealistic district attorney to the tormented Two-Face, adding a layer of tragedy to the story. Nolan's masterful direction elevates \"The Dark Knight\" to an intellectually stimulating experience. The film's themes are explored through morally complex situations that challenge both the characters and the audience. It is a tale of heroism and sacrifice, exploring the consequences of choices made in the name of justice. Beyond the riveting performances and engaging story, \"The Dark Knight\" boasts exceptional cinematography and groundbreaking practical effects, making Gotham City a character in its own right. The action sequences are breathtaking, and Hans Zimmer's haunting score perfectly complements the film's brooding atmosphere. As with any cinematic masterpiece, \"The Dark Knight\" is not without its minor flaws. Some viewers may find the film's runtime a touch lengthy, but the intricate storytelling and character development justify every minute. In conclusion, \"Batman: The Dark Knight\" is a genre-defining film that leaves an enduring impact on the viewer. Nolan's vision, coupled with outstanding performances, makes this movie a true gem in the pantheon of superhero cinema. If you seek a thought-provoking, visually stunning, and emotionally resonant experience, \"The Dark Knight\" is an absolute must-watch."

Ya que nos mostraron el concepto de ¿qué pasaría si el héroe que todos admiran, fracasa y cae? Ya que vemos como el Joker demuestra cómo es ser un villano bien escrito y que tiene establecido sus motivaciones. El mismo enseño como el mundo sería sin reglas. Ya que, al ver todos los momentos impactantes, las pérdidas humanas de personajes clave y el ver como Harvey Dent, el caballero blanco de Gotham, termina cayendo en ese círculo del caos mismo y se vuelve en su contraparte es muy impactante. El Caballero de la Noche nos enseña que el cine de superhéroes puede ser mucho mejor si exploramos el lado realista de los conceptos. 10/10."
