    "review": "Check out this one for the thrilling, well crafted fight sequences and the exciting action-hero turn from Charlize, who’s simply sensational here. But apart from those qualities, the rest of The Old Guard is frankly pretty dopey! I didn’t really care much about any of the rest of the cast of comparatively underdeveloped characters (although Ejiofor lends able support). So, although I’m unenthusiastic about the sequel, I’ll likely tune in anyway if only because of Charlize."

    "review": "The Old Guard falls disappointingly flat. The film, which somehow holds an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, is a textbook example of style over substance — and even the style starts to wear thin quickly. From the opening scenes, it becomes painfully clear that the story is both predictable and unimaginative. The film drags through familiar action-fantasy tropes without offering anything fresh or compelling. Plot twists can be seen from miles away, and even the action sequences — which should be the film’s saving grace — feel uninspired and repetitive. What’s even more jarring is the dialogue. Conversations lack depth, emotion, and often come across as unintentionally laughable. The characters, who are supposed to carry centuries of pain and wisdom, speak like they’ve just walked out of a first draft script. There’s no real chemistry between the team, and their interactions feel more robotic than human. The Old Guard is a forgettable, overhyped action flick that squanders its potential and leaves little desire for a sequel — though Netflix has green light one anyway. DO NOT WATCH."

    "review": "If you love your heroes to be a little surly with realistic outlooks then you'll love this movie. The group has been around a long time and are resolved to just exist now. You can definitely say life has worn them out, so what's the point any more. The new person to the group creates some challenges. With as old as our hereos are, they realize there is still more to learn. The character growth with the old and the new is satisfying to watch. Add in trying to not become everlasting science experiments and you have a lot of good action. I am very eager to see the second movie coming out this July 2nd."

I really wish I could say part of the story is unrealistic, but it's not.

Even Andy doesn’t know when forever is over for all of them It’s tempting that we all want to stop disease and suffering as much as the next person But things like profit and obsessing with living forever can cloud our judgement and working towards the bigger picture Living forever is truly harder than it looks, just because you keep living doesn’t mean you stop hurting, does knowing make us sleep better?, sooner or later everything dies, we don’t have all the answers but we do have purpose, it’s nearly impossible to disappear in the world we live in today this really is one of the better Netflix features and that's saying something it totally brought me back to Noomi Rapace in 'Monday to Friday' cause it had that same kinetic energy, badass female quality, and excitement 'Old Guard' has a terrific mix of fun action, lots of bloody violence, and digging deep into the question of mortality vs immortality it's true that nothing actually lives forever plus it's never easy when you do there's even a badass soundtrack to match this modern superhero vibe if a majority of streaming content has been okay to just plain bad these days then this is the movie to get the ball rolling again and I totally wouldn't mind seeing future installments down the line very happy this was way better than I thought"

It was not the notion of immortality or a female leader that didst challenge my suspension of disbelief, but rather the casting choices and motives that felt lacking in both realism and logic. The characters, though portrayed by capable actors, didst fail to convince me of their authenticity, leaving me questioning their actions and intentions. Furthermore, a grievous oversight was observed upon the set, for the prop master allowed bullet casings to fall, revealing complete bullets therein. Such a rookie mistake doth shatter the illusion of authenticity and attention to detail. Let it be known that while the concept of the film held promise, it didst falter in its execution, leaving me yearning for a greater adherence to realism and logical coherence. The dismissal of the prop master mayhaps be warranted, for their oversight hath marred the overall believability of the production."

I will not ramble on about the 1st act; unclear setup, weak character development, shoddy motivations in terms of story growth.. leading to an even more insignificant 2nd and 3rd. Instead I will focus on: NEEDLE DROPS, NEEDLE DROPS, NEEDLE DROPS. Help me understand here. I'm 3 minutes into the movie and already there is a \"fresh dubstepish autotune \" track snaking in&out randomly. This is a non-diegetic needle drop; this means it is not part of the story. This means it has been selected and placed here by the creators of the movie. Note; this is not the score of the film, it's a song drop. Now... it does not match the mood of the sequence. It does not fit thematically. It does not portray any feeling that supports the story. Moreover, it does not follow the beat/ rhythm of the editing as a music video would. It flutters around aimlessly like a dung fly. Immediately, I'm questioning the choice here; was it placed by the director because he happened to have this \"cool\" track on his Spotify? Was it placed there by the production who happen to support this artist at that time? Was it placed there by a committee in the name of \"freshifying\" the film for \"younger\" audiences? That shit makes me mad, there is no need for it. This happens endlessly.. it's cheap and simplistic all in the name of \" currently hip\". Even in fight sequences, the edit seems to struggle to keep up with the track, or vice-versa. I'm reminded of the movie Blade. However, there, the movie is designed to fit along with the \"techno tracks\" for the effect, it is not an afterthought. I can't digest this, I'm immediately torn away from the story. I'm immediately imagining the \"coke lined\" conversations in the editing room about who heard a \"sick track\" in the club and how to dump it in there... infuriating! Certainly, good movies are immortal and so are bad ones. In this one, what cannot die is my boredom. The movie is a solid 50% gray; minus one star for shit \"Needle Drops\"; rounding down to a 1 star rating. ps: good job on the bullet holes"

    "review": "Andromache \"Andy\" of Scythia (Charlize Theron), Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts), Joe (Marwan Kenzari), and Nicky (Luca Marinelli) are centuries-old warriors with unexplained regenerative healing abilities who use their vast experience to work as mercenaries, taking missions that help people. Breaking their rule of never working for the same employers twice, they accept a job from former CIA operative James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to rescue a group of kidnapped girls in South Sudan. During the mission, which proves to be a ruse, they are ambushed and killed. After quickly recovering and killing their attackers, they realize that Copley set them up and remotely filmed their regeneration. Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, U.S. Marine Nile Freeman has her throat slit while taking down a military target during a house search, only to recover without a scratch. Later, she shares a disturbing dream with the other immortals, who are then alerted to her existence, as they experience dreams of any new immortals until found. Andy tracks down a confused Nile and extracts her from Afghanistan before military personnel can transfer her for further testing. Copley shows the video of the ambush to pharmaceutical executive Steven Merrick, who sends operatives to capture the team. Andy brings Nile to a safe house in France, where she meets the rest of their team. She is told about the female immortal Quynh, the first of Andy's comrades, who was captured, accused of witchcraft, and lost to them when cast somewhere into the sea in an iron maiden, and has been continually drowning ever since. The group also reveals that they are not truly immortal: their ability to heal eventually stops, without warning, which happened to a previous immortal, Lykon... Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads: \"The Old Guard is occasionally restricted by genre conventions, but director Gina Prince-Bythewood brings a sophisticated vision to the superhero genre - and some knockout action sequences led by Charlize Theron.\" Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a \"B+\" and said: \"Steeped in hand-to-hand action... but with enough ballistic firepower to kit out a small civil war, every action sequence is more than awe-inspiring; they're necessary to the film itself. Superhero battles that are eye popping and narratively motivated? Oh, yeah.\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety called the film a \"watchable franchise wannabe\" and wrote: \"Chunks of the picture are logy and formulaic (it dawdles on for two hours), but the director, Gina Prince-Bythewood (making a major lane change after Love & Basketball and The Secret Life of Bees), stages the fight scenes with ripe executionary finesse, and she teases out a certain soulful quality in her cast.\" Bob Chipman of Escapist gave the film 7 out of 10 and said: \"This is a clever, slick, progressive minded, yet also brutally violent, frequently kick ass action film\" and that \"they clearly want it to be a franchise, I'd certainly watch another one.\" Tom Breihan, for The A.V. Club, wrote, \"The Old Guard is a superhero story; it's just one of the many superhero stories that attempts to subvert superhero stories. [...] Though The Old Guard tackles superhero-movie cliches in interesting ways, it has more difficulty with the emerging conventions of the Netflix movie\" \"The Old Guard\" is based on Greg Rucka´s comic book of the same name which I haven´t red. There´s an ok concept as the foundation, but due to wobbly acting and a plot that just drags as the running time is too long, it´s not all that exciting in my book. Charlize Theron is always solid, but she was a better bad ass in \"Atomic Blonde\" in my opinion. And I think as well that the action is not fully convincing as the choreography is too \"clear\". The film's portrayal of LGBT characters within the \"superhero\" universe is ok, but at the same time if feels a bit forced in the scene structure. The \"The Old Guard\" is just so so. Trivia: It was reported on January 27, 2021 that Netflix had greenlit a sequel. On August 26, it was announced that with Victoria Mahoney will replace Prince-Bythewood as director for the sequel. Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Veronica Ngo and Chiwetel Ejiofor will reprise their respective roles from the original movie."

The characters are incredibly real in their diversity as well as their backstory. They exist as real, flawed, and whole all at once. This is a film that breaks out of the traditional mold of an action movie with soulful performances from the cast. You learn their love, their loss, their joy, and their sorrow in ways that traditional action movies would never allow for their one-sided hypermasculine protagonists.

The original comic books, which I read only because of this movie, I found to be simply blunt. It felt, actually, like they really wanted to be a very mediocre action movie, but turned out to be comic books, and were really disappointed because of that. And, lo and behold, some filmmakers, like some kind of fairy godmother, magically changed them into what they always dreamed to be. Only this is not a mediocre action movie; it is somewhat above the average, but no thanks to the comics, as the filmmakers needed to expand the flat (story-wise) originals a little and trim its pretentious narration in order to achieve that. Only the acting seemed somewhat off at places, but maybe it is just that the actors quoted too accurately some of the cheesiest lines form the comic books."

Yes, folks are tripping over themselves to smooch the feet of Charlize Theron, and though that would not be a dilemma if ever the opportunity arose, there is more, much more worthy viewings in this actor's cannon. Yes, \"The Old Guard\" ticks off a lot of the inclusivity possibilities long ignored by Hollywood, but just past the feel good political correctness lurks a very mundane comic book action movie. And folks, those are really not cinema, just silly escapism fluff, the fast food of the big screen, and should be categorized as such. Just ask Martin Scorsese. Yes, this film has plenty of kickass hand to hand fights to satiate that demographic, but when the heroes are immortal, is there really any suspense in the combat, and the inevitable story line? Yes, there's a bit of kryptonite leaking into the picture to try and throw a wee bit of a curve into the plot, but c'mon, who are we kidding? This is an action hero movie. Yes, everything here is perfectly staged, orchestrated, and manipulated to the Nth degree, but it feels one dimensional, just like a, er, comic book. Any attempts at empathy and character depth seem way out of place, and little more than place holders till the next battle scene roars to life. Yes, some folks really, and I mean really like this sorta thing, and they will enjoy the ride. And some folks are a bit tired of easy bake movies, no matter how good the intention.

    "review": "Picked this movie on a complete whim without much knowledge of the plot beforehand and was blown away. Honestly I suggest doing the same - I wish Netflix's plot summary didn't give away the fantasy immortal aspect because the first 10 minutes work to carefully intrigue the viewer with the barest of information. This allows the characters to establish themselves through the small details, the way Andy tucks Nicky's head close when she sees him again for the first time, the easy familiarity of Joe and Booker's bet on Andy's ability to pin point a baklava's exact ingredients. Like others have said, this is an action movie that goes beyond a bloodbath for Charlize Theron, the relationships are at the center of the story with some brutal violence that raises the stakes. The two hours flew by, can't recommend this enough."

    "review": "The actual plot of The Old Guard may be somewhat rote action movie material (and the soundtrack doesn't help), but the movie is elevated from 'enjoyable but forgettable' status through its commitment to its characters and the ties which bind them, as well as its fresh take on action scenes. There is a touchingly real connection between the immortals, and a gravitas to their lives that the movie takes the time to dwell on; it is these themes which Gina Prince-Bythewood and the (terrific) cast convincingly sell as the true core of the story- the whole kidnapping big pharma business is just a blip in the face of their shared history. Similarly, while the premise certainly lends novelty to the fight scenes, it is really the characters' relationships to one another and to violence itself that shift the perspective on them. If Netflix can churn out not one but three Kissing Booth movies, here's hoping The Old Guard gets greenlit for at least the singular sequel it was setting up."

The story is pretty straightforward with the usual cliches for this genre, but Theron brings her excellent acting to her role, lifting the film to slightly above average. The fight scenes are particularly exciting and the characters are pretty god. And there are a couple of thought-provoking ideas about immortality. It's just over 2 hours long which is, perhaps, a bit too long. But, overall, it's enjoyable enough entertainment."

    "review": "ASTOUNDING. Every time I watch it, this movie gets better and better as the subtleties are drawn out. Everyone is psychologized with an intimate realness, the stakes are heartbreaking and pulse-pounding at once, and the scale of equitable representation of all races, sexualities, and personal creeds is just unmatched. There's sickeningly adorable, inter-racial, inter-religious gay love, varied representations of both masculine and feminine ideals in imagery, and exceptional attention to detail in painting the psychological profiles of each character and their arc of development... Ugh, it's no wonder that fandom is basically going feral over this story. The set staging and costuming and even the make-up is just all arranged so poignantly to convey tiny details from which eons of history can be extrapolated. And none of that even begins to cover the utter majesty of the fight-scenes. I've been rewatching this movie at least twice a week since it came out and every time I do, I pull more out of the fight choreography-- the shear incredible coordination displayed in their intimate teamwork, the way the fights almost build more backstory to the characters than the conversation moments, and the way pieces of fight-technique from all across history and all around the world are seamlessly combined according to each individual character's experiences... I just cannot give even HALF enough praise to both Gina Prince-Bythewood for directing this masterpiece and to Daniel Hernandez for coordinating some of the most epic fight scenes I have ever seen in my entire life. Seriously, every single time I watch this I get more AMAZINGNESS out of it."

I really didn't like Harry Melling as the chief baddie, Melling. He lacked presence and menace.

It has a pretty uninspired plot, pretty weak villain, but interesting side characters, like Chiwetel Ejiofor's character. The actions scenes aren't necessarily my favorite; they have a little too many hand-held cam shots and a bit more cuts than what I would personally want. But the stunt work is very good, as is the choregraphy, which makes them still pretty entertaining. The acting is definitely the best part of this movie, in my opinion. Charlize Theron and as I mentioned before, Chiwetel Ejiofor did a really great job. A stand-out also was KiKi Layne, who delivered a very strong performance. But the real problem of this movie in my opinion is the lack of character development. We hardly know anything about Charlize Theron's character, besides two or three flashbacks at most. Not to mention KiKi Layne's character, which is hardly given a backstory, or how she got those powers. And also, the movie never really explains how those powers even work, or how does one get them, how does one lose them, etc. Another problem is the soundtrack. It definitely didn't fit the movie at all, but I don't mind it too much. So if you're looking for a movie with Charlize Theron kicking some ass in a decent amount of action scenes, which are pretty decent, you are probably gonna have a good time watching this."

The fight scenes are fantastic. I wouldn't want to get into a fight with Charlize (Andy), because she is fearsome and cynical, understandably so, If I were hundred's of years old I'd be a cynical ninja too. I hope. The plot is decent, and the story is predictable and interesting. There is a fun set up for a sequel at the end, so hopefully they give us a second film. It would be nice to see Veronica Ngo get more screen time, because she deserves to lead a film for once. Her screen time was too brief in Star Wars and it's the same in this film. Honestly, they built up this awesome story line and then... I don't want to ruin it, but there are SO many questions. I wanna Know what Ngo knows and how Ngo ain't in the box no mo. (Rhymes are fun!)

It has a lot of emotional depth along with some great action sequences, but the story overall becomes stuck in the conventional superhero story. Throughout the film, I liked the characters, especially Theron, who always can play a badass as well as the best of them, but I kept feeling that they did not have the material to work with that would have made this a more cutting-edge superhero film.

A new person with the same abilities (KiKi Layne) reveals herself at an inopportune time. Will the group be able to keep their identities a secret? Now I didn't know a lot about this, I just knew that there was a supernatural angle to it. Charlize Theron has already gone and proven herself to be a bonafide action star, so this is a logical project for her. Even though The Old Guard isn't perfect, it is still watchable, and I do believe that there is an audience out there for this. Now even though it isn't advertised, this is based on a graphic novel, which makes sense. It's the type of story that would work in that format, and even though I'm not familiar with the source material, I could easily see somebody running with it and green lighting the project after a read-through of the comic. It starts almost like Extraction, and then that's when the supernatural curveball is thrown. This is where I feel that this movie is at its strongest: because you want to know what the deal is with this group, you want to see that that mystery explored. It also explains that while these people are immortal, there's also a clock on how many times they can be killed, so it does make it so there are stakes. If they didn't do that, then you would just have an X-Men Origins: Wolverine situation where the characters are constantly healing, so, therefore, you never care if anybody gets hurt or not. As just an action movie, I think this works on the whole. There are a few too many bombastic pop songs for my taste, but the action is clear and well-choreographed, so I give credit where credit is due. Charlize is damn fine at doing movies like this; it's not like she is built like Abby from The Last of Us Part II, but she could easily beat me up if she wanted to. Because her acting abilities are just as quality as her physicality, it makes her completely deserving of being an action star. The Old Guard is a decent way to kill two hours, and it passes the time. I never connected with it on an emotional level, and I felt like the characters could have used a bit more punch up writing to make this more fun. It is a team on a mission movie like The Dirty Dozen or The A-Team, and while it never hits the same marks as either of those films, I never felt overly negative about it at any point. It does run on the long side, and I think if they could have whittled this down to about 100 minutes, I would have liked it more. As it stands, this is just decent."

And even though I knew her fight scenes were all choreographed and green screened, she moved like a real \"pro\"! The movie is very fun to watch, a great date night movie, with lots of well acted emotions and plenty of excellent fight scenes! I was writhing and kicking and punching right along with them and they just kept getting better and better! And I loved the story. Sure, there were a number of times when I asked, 'huh, why didn't she...', 'wait, why are they...', 'hmm, they should just...', but all in all the story line was interesting and engaging and makes you want more and want to know more (sequel PLEASE!). I especially loved the fact that the young newbie, played by Kiki Layne, was strong throughout without succumbing to the weaker trappings of Hollywood femininity, and much like Charlize, Ms Layne gave us a woman who was both beautiful and fierce without compromise, yet not lacking in emotion and soul. Oh and kudos to the openly gay couple, WITHIN the team! Not just one of them pining for a lost boyfriend, oh, excuse me, NOT boyfriend! That was terrific! I cannot wait for the sequel! Thank you Charlize!!!"

Theron is great as usual, and the supporting actors are decent enough not to detract from their characters.There is time dedicated to the relationships between the leads that makes them so compelling. It's so refreshing to see lead female characters who are well developed and completely free of sexualisation - maybe that's what you get for a female director. Minority characters were natural and didn't feel like they were included just for brownie points, which is rare in comic/action movies. The music is an interesting choice which worked quite well most of the time (except for one scene where the song felt way too distracting). The fight scenes are incredible, well choreographed and the characters have their own styles - I especially loved the mix of weapons used and their slick teammwork. The only problem, they are a bit too over-edited at times and sometimes it was hard to tell what was going on, there were also parts where the movie dragged and two hours is maybe just slightly too long. I also would have liked to see more time dedicated to the historical backstories, to truly get a sense of how old there are and how long they have been fighting. But overall a well-directed, interesting action movie with compelling characters and good action, definitely worth watching."

The directing is very messy, I can tell the director wants to express lots of things but it's a movie not a tv show. Too many scenes plans too on purpose, they are just so conveniently stand by the window after the fight and so conveniently fall from the window lol.

Charlize theron's character had a cool backstory, but again, character-wise she was just a brick, and she looked like she was just phoning it in. Kiki Layne is probably the worst one among them. She came across clumsy and loud to me. Spewing out line after line with no emotion. I had difficulty suspending my disbelief whenever she held a gun. Chiwetel Ejiofor's terrific acting, unfortunately, highlighted Layne's bad acting even more. The action scenes were pure cringe. The choreographer put in one too many matrix moves, and left the rest up to the editor to sloppily mash together. The sad thing is, they actually spent money on this. The story could have been a really cool saga. A superhero universe on its own. But the writing and execution was amateurish. They paid Theron and Ejiofor's salaries for this crap???"

At times the fight scenes came off so staged and robotic. Some of them were just too damn long. The very first action scene will be enough to draw you in though, maybe even keep you there wanting more. I've never seen anything like it so it was a treat. But after a while it's just so dislocated, overly serious, and just a bit unbelievable. I'm glad I watched it though. This could be something with some new writers, like a part 2. It's interesting enough to give it a shot. It didn't need 2 hours so this movie is a bit dragged out - especially toward the end. Charlize Theron was really good in her role. The new girl was cool. Book was pretty good in his role. The 2 gay guys really didn't fit, seemed forced. I fast forwarded past most of their ridiculous scenes that made zero sense in the film. Poor character choices."

    "review": "What happens when you take elements from superhero films and the John Wick franchise? Basically, you yield \"The Old Guard\". \"The Old Guard\" (dir. Gina Prince-Bythewood) introduces a bit of a unique take on \"plot armour\"; it is literally the device in the story. Our heroes in this film are VERY difficult to kill. They've been around for centuries and have had major impacts in world events throughout time. With this story, the plot armour actually serves a purpose; it makes sense in the narrative, which I can commend. In addition, the world building and mythology in the film add a level of creativity which I genuinely didn't expect. If you need just one reason to see the film, that reason is Charlize Theron. Is there nothing this lady can not do? She can do drama, action, comedy...she can be cheered on as the hero, or the she can be detested as the villain. In this film, she is bad-ass/kick-ass and that's enough for me in a summer action-blockbuster. The supporting cast fit in well (save one, which I'll get to later). Each player has their own motivations and conflicts and those elements drive the story forward without losing any major momentum. The action sequences are simply ok. This film focuses more on coverage and cutting in the edit to cheat the action rather than the intense level of choreography seen in the John Wick franchise. In addition, some of the music choices for the action worked well to add a pulse to the scene, but in more settled scenes, it made me feel like I was listening to the Teen Pop Choice Awards. Jumping back to the supporting roles, nothing brings my film experience down more than a weak villain, and in \"The Old Guard\" we get the epitome of that cliche. We've seen this countless times in film and TV: the bad guy is a CEO who only cares about his profits, overcoming his competitors and always says \"I expect RESULTS!\". I mean, do you seen what I'm getting at? It's bland and boring. Overall, I think \"The Old Guard\" works as a decent popcorn flick if you want some violent action, but not gruesome and grotesque enough to have a scene change to Black & White (looking at you, Kill Bill). Fuck it...kick back, and have fun with it. See you at the movies."

Assaults a total of three marines. Steals a Humvee. And then drives through the desert unpursued. Seriously? Camp Leatherneck is one of the most heavily fortified places ON THE PLANET. Just stealing a Humvee--never mind driving it off base--would be an impossibility. The fact the filmmakers chose to ignore these details is just one example of how they were all too willing to surrender any sense of credibility when surrendering credibility was required for the sake of the plot. Also, two characters get knocked unconscious when it suits the plot, one by a karate chop to the neck and the other by the strike to the back of the head with a polymer-framed pistol. Really? A karate chop to the neck? What is this? Star Trek TOS? I really wanted to like this more. but there were just too many instances of utter disbelief. A pilot is shot at and plays dead while flying a plane. Was the shot a blank? If not, um, where did the bullet go? Never explained. Automatic gunfire in London over an extended period, the heroes take their sweet time afterward getting into their car and driving away, and only then do pedestrians and the London Police arrive on the scene? Just. So. Freaking. Lazy."

    "review": "Predictable. Another highly rated yet terrible film. The writing is flat out bad from the cringey dialogue to the ridiculous premise. The plot is predictable as well. The villain is one of the worst I've seen in several years of watching films. The acting was below average for the most part, and the characters were generic. They tried to create a badass female lead like Ripley from Alien but failed miserably. The soundtrack didn't fit with what was on screen most of the time and god knows why they went with EDM/electronic music - it was laughably bad. Some of the action was fine but most of it was bland. The only acceptable aspects were the cinematography and visual effects, and the visual effects were far from the best. Avoid this garbage and watch a decent action film like Mission Impossible Fallout, Die Hard, any of the classics - there are so many good films to choose from."

This causes the emotional beats to lie flat and the intensity of the dangerous situations to be greatly diminished by the lack of character development and stakes as the audience really could care less about what happens to our heroes as there simply is no connection to them. Overall the film lacks a good plot that keeps the audience invested and drags the whole film down as a whole despite an interesting concept."

I actually was more interested in the backstory of the characters living through history than the modern day story, the flashbacks are really intriguing.

    "review": "The Old Guard has an interesting premise but the filmmaker choice wasn't ideal. The never ending soundtrack is distracting and laughable at times. The key to the films success is the cast and the second unit action director. It was nice to see Greg Rucka wrote the screenplay as he created the original comic the film is based on. Theron is the key here and she controls the screen from the opening scene. She's clearly is at home with the action genre and it's refreshing to see studios gamble on female lead roles. The Old Guard lacks a central villain worthy of the running time but there's enough characters and story here to ensure there's a sequel down the line. Netflix clearly have the interest of star quality so it's refreshing to have original films that aren't built on top of Marvel and DC properties. The Old Guard may be an adaptation but it's from an indie Image Comics label and only has a small loyal fan base. Fingers crossed Netflix dials down and delivers a sequel for us. I hope they replace the filmmaker but I suspect that won't happen due to the films success, hopefully they can substitute the endless music with an actual film score. 10/07/2020"

In all their scenes they manage to bring strength, leadership and even sensitivity, showing their humanity, and their concern to maintain that humanity even considering their abilities. The characters are not necessarily innovative, the type of \"hero's journey\" story has been done over and over again. This can leave the tone of the film cliché, but I believe that this production does not try to focus on this factor necessarily. The Old Guard is what appears to be an introduction to the group, showing the strengths of each character as well as their weaknesses, their complexity, bringing discussions that could currently be considered clichés or even unnecessary, leaving some doubts about the past of their characters and the limitation of their powers, which leaves opening for a sequence and expansion of the world in which they live, and with great action scenes capable of entertaining anyone."

It seems like the logic is thrown right out the window, when you say to yourself, \"Well, what about the people that's killed? Isn't there going to be somebody who's a good person within those people's bloodlines?\" BTW, it's definitely a chick flick. Even though they have no special powers, other than the fact that their immortal (again, sort of)... the women seem to never tire out, even though there killing 50 people by themselves (hyperbole, yes, but you'll definitely see). Yet, two of the guys that are immortal (sort of) too, just can't seem to fight off a squad of five people. Anyway, this movie will certainly pass the time.

So he's less than convincing acting, took all the suspense out of the film. Sucked the life out of it. Plus the story gets muddled as well. Another bad guy, turns out to be a kind of good guy. He's acting wasn't great either. Sigh. The rest of the cast, especially Charlize Theron, carried this film. Her and Kiki Layne, were REALLY good. Kind of balanced this mess out. It's not a bad film. It's just the budget creaked, and it looked like it needed more money put into it. My favourite bits were actually the flashbacks. I wanted more of those.

    "review": "Really interesting aspects to it. Every once in a while it would pique my interest and rope me back in. Unfortunately some of the development of the new young immortal was pretty tedious to sit through. Am I the only one these days tired of the trope of someone resenting their new powers and wishing they didn't have them? That's just really getting painful to sit through, when we know at the end of the day they're going to accept their new powers. How much screen time do we have to sit through for this process? The antagonist is typical. Good actor, but fairly one-dimensional I think. What's REALLY unfortunate is the choice of annoying music. It's what prompted me to bother to sign in and write a review. I think that cutting time out of a movie to insert some new song with lyrics semi-relevant to the plot is the worst idea EVER. It pulls you right out of the movie and makes you feel like you're watching some very very very very crappy music video. Here we are, watching the character on screen do nothing while a song plays. Soundtracks with lyrics are a really bad move, in my opinion. (Unless music and and actors singing is part of the movie, obviously, a la Lion King). For over a full minute as the climax of the ACTION movie is coming, we're subjected to a slow, sad, solemn song about going down fighting. For 40 seconds of that we're stuck just looking at the character in an elevator doing nothing. Never once have I felt any interest in this character, and I sure as hell am not along for the ride here as the climax of the movie is about to kick off. What the hell were they thinking? Were they trying to use songs to do all of the heavy lifting for their story telling? It continues through the action as if the movie is just there to supplement the songs, whereas in say, Guardians of the Galaxy, it feels like they're using classic well-known and loved songs to supplement the MOVIE. This movie had potential and some interesting parts for sure, but those were underdeveloped in favour of watching the young protagonist pout and be sad. The action is so-so, the security guards are generally incompetent as with most movies, so that the heroes can try all their cool moves on them without much resistance. At the end of the day I think the movie just asks too much of the viewer and immersion is ruined."

    "review": "A new arrival in the post-John Wick action film renaissance, Gina Price-Bythewood's filmography in romance and drama explains the tenderness she affords the war hero characters of The Old Guard. She may take a few beats to get the ball rolling on the tone of the film, but once the axe is swinging in full force, the audience are treated to fight scenes like no others. Blending typical superhero action, which glorifies military precision with gunshot-quick cuts, and the choreographed elegance of swordplay creates a dramatic fusion that is unmistakably unique to the director. Rather than the typical trailer-friendly foghorn that accompanies the action films of today, the Old Guard is enhanced by an ethereal choir bolstered by a pop soundtrack (With contemporary artists such as Khalid and Marshmello) that emphasises the grace of a female-led battle for justice. Charlize Theron seems the perfect fit for centuries-old warrior Andromache of Scythia, after establishing her signature stone-cold butch performance in Atomic Blonde and The Fate of the Furious. The first act, set in Morocco and then South Sudan, visually resembles the post 9/11 war films that have ensnared the gentler bodybuilders of Hollywood in a patriarchal romp (Think Chris Hemsworth in 12 Strong or John Krasinski in 13 Hours). The film starts with a feeling of dread that Theron's acting capabilities have been misused in a one-dimensional role – The white soldier who is bringing peace and democracy to an eternally hostile developing world – But the introduction of KiKi Layne instead lets Theron shepherd the young immortal in a refreshing role of maturity and guidance. Layne's naivety and Theron's experience clash in a hand-to-hand duel aboard a turbulent plane journey, using Price-Bythewood's distinct action directing to quickly introduce us to these unique characters' relationship. The ensemble of toughened superheroes feels a little underworked – Again, seeing them in their bearded, sunglassed glory amongst disparaged people of colour reminds viewers of the patriarchal veterans that paraded across the screen in problematic productions like American Sniper, but their empathic abilities highlight them as interpreters of dreams and navigators of an arcane, alternative world. The feminine mysticism of understanding and compassion is, in a triumph of intersectionality, extended to male characters as well as female. The conditions for adapting the graphic novel even demanded an explicit love scene between the two male characters of Joe and Nicky (Marwan Kenzari and Luca Marinelli), which is an excellent example of combatting the heteronormative tendencies of contemporary cinema – The scene itself, however, suffers from overly flowery text, which feels far too elevated compared to the rest of the film's boorish dialogue. The exchanges between characters is the weakest part of the picture. As the aforementioned plane plummets without the aid of a pilot, Andromache remarks that they don't need a pilot – But a sudden tremor prompts her to correct herself and request to be unbound: \"Maybe we do need a pilot. I know how to fly a plane.\" Too many times are cool lines trod all over by the need to exposition them further later on. \"I thought you said we were going to Paris?\" \"We're just outside of Paris.\" Is a necessary correction to explain the secluded church the characters land near. \"I thought you said we were immortal?\" \"We mostly are, but we can die.\" Is the worst example of characters backtracking their previously badass dialogue. There's far too much fat to be trimmed, and screenwriter Greg Rucka simply doesn't know how to make grizzled, cynical warriors also speak clearly and helpfully. It feels even worse when they discuss their Romantic-era nature as travelling do-gooders, a concept that isn't well translated in the vernacular of the 21st century. Brief flashbacks to ages past, where our heroes battle for good in period outfits signify a welcomed departure from the seriousness of modern-day action. The recollections of medieval torture make for suitable morals about the dangers of immortality – The grumpy attitudes of our 2020 heroes do not. Andromache's bitterness towards the ever-declining state of humanity is undone when she receives an act of charity from a pharmacy worker, who gives an overly saccharine speech about the value of good deeds. A third-act monologue from Chiwetel Ejiofor, explaining all of humanity's most progressive minds that owe their lives to Andromache acts as a more appropriate keystone of the film's moral, but somehow feels more rushed – Rather than frantically gesturing to his corkboard collage, the scene might have benefitted from the historical throwbacks that are occasionally dangled before viewers. The antagonist, pharmaceutical CEO Steven Merrick, played by grown-up Harry Potter bully Harry Melling is yet another example of the unremarkable trendy executives as supervillains, struggling to learn from the sour taste that Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, or Riz Ahmed in Venom left behind. Merrick seems incapable of acting out two lines before reminding the audience that he loves the financial opportunities his evil scheme affords, and the female genius he seems to be exploiting for research never even speaks – Though a male-driven industry's harvesting of women's intelligence may be a point the director wishes to make, Dr Meta Kozak is thrown only one line of dialogue, making her more of the fat on the script that the screenwriter struggles to trim. The Old Guard is worth a watch – Viewers will find themselves undeniably attached to the characters and intrigued by the dramatic sequel opportunities the epilogue affords, and Gina Price-Bythewood is an empowered female director, balancing action and heart, who is unfortunately slowed down by comic-book veteran Greg Rucka's inexperience with the teleplay format. Hopefully the fresh action and earnest performances of The Old Guard can inspire future directors of the genre for only half as long as Andromache of Scythia's dark retribution has been guiding humanity towards feminist progress."

    "review": "With more movies constantly being delayed because of the Coronavirus, the only new movies appearing seems to be streaming service movies. The Old Guard is an American superhero (sort of) movie based on the comic book of the same name. It is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood who I'll be honest I am not familiar with and also written by Greg Rucka who wrote the comic book. I was very interested in watching this movie after seeing the first trailer as the premise of immortal badasses sounds very interesting. Plus it has Charlize Theron who is awesome and Chiwetel Ejiofor who has always been great in my opinion. First things I will praise is the main heroes cast. Charlize is still pretty badass as \"Andy\" and very convincingly so. The new recruit \"Nile Freeman\" played by KiKi Layne gives a great performance as a sort of POV character for the viewer. The supporting cast is also pretty good with Matthias Schoenaerts as \"Booker\" giving a very conflicting emotion to being an immortal, Marwan Kenzari as \"Joe\" who gives a very memorable speech while being very romantic and Luca Marinelli as \"Nicky\" who is quite the witty guy. Every single one of them is quite charming and from their performance alone can give the audience a sense of their personality. Most of the actors are also great in these action scenes and it is very obvious that these actors threw themselves into practising these action scenes themselves. The villains in this movie, however, is something I am quite mixed about. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays one of the villain \"James Copley\" who is meant to be more sympathetic and there is a great emotional performance from him in the third act, comes out as very predictable and plain. Harry Melling from Harry Potter fame as \"Steven Merrick\" who is the main villain for the second half comes out as over the top and cartooney which contrasts massively with the others who are more grounded and believable. The action scenes are very clearly inspired by John Wick and are pretty cool to watch albeit they don't do anything new with it. They are filmed a bit weird with a lot of zooms and sometimes random shaky cam although the shakiness isn't Jason Bourne bad and are still visible. My problem is the lack of action scenes. There are not a lot which is kind of disappointing and the trailer pretty much showed all the action scenes in the movie. The premise with the immortals which is one of the reasons why I wanted to watch the movie is generally pretty good and utilised mostly effectively but no character ever loses a limb which is a shame considering you have immortal characters. The rules of their immortality is a bit iffy and not completely explained which kind of irks me a bit and feels a little bit lazy. The story is something I am also a bit mixed about. The first half of the movie with it about training a new immortal \"Nile\" is really enjoyable. Seeing the conflict between long time immortal \"Andy\" and new immortal was great and seeing their different opinions about life was interesting. The emotional moments in the movie are great as well. Seeing \"Nile\" clash with the fact that she can't even die or age and realising she might not ever see her family again was saddening. \"Andy\" and \"Booker\" talking about their heart-wrenching past with flashbacks to help illustrate it as well is genuinely great stuff. As I stated before but \"James Copley\" gives a believable explanation to his motive that is very sympathetic. If this movie did anything right then it was these emotional moments and fleshing out the characters. However, the second half of this movie feels like a cliche of superhero movies and turns this movie into feeling generic. They now have to take down over the top bad guy dude from Harry Potter and this is where the story takes a large dip for me. My final criticism with the movie has got to be the soundtrack. It sucks. The soundtrack contains a lot of pop songs which kind of took me out of the movie as it tends to contrast with the scene that was happening right now. For example, they play a pop song to build up an action scene and it just feels dumb. Overall, despite my fair amount of criticism, the movie is okay. It doesn't do anything revolutionary or make me come out of it feeling something or thinking about something but I did still have a good time. The movie premise had great ideas but might have worked a lot better as a TV show in my opinion. Still, it does end with the blatant sequel tease and despite it all, I would be interested in watching a sequel."

    "review": "The old Guard mixes elements from The Highlander an John Wick to an excellent action Flick. Despite the topic of immortality, the action scenes appear real and authentic. The sequences are fast paces without loosing he focus on the protagonists and stay away from using too many hectic cuts. Of course the overall story arc follows the typical super hero movie plot...there is a new hero arising just discovering her new powers, there is the old sarcastic group member (Theron) who grows and and is rediscovering her motivation through the \"young flesh\"...there is betrayal and there is the stupid antagonist who just waits for being finished off at the end (although this is a finish with a boom) and there is an open end with an \"unexpected\" reveal! However, the chemistry of the cast, the aforementioned action sequences, the embedding into the historical context and the awesome photography make the whole movie so enjoyable, that soon after the end credit you want to watch it again or desperately start waiting for a sequel. Hopefully the quality standard can be kept up for a sequel without too much producer's intervention aiming for a teenage audience."

And what really stand out is it's action packed! Usually netflix films have low budgets in terms or production but this one was an exception! The story kept a lot of mystery unanswered, perhaps it will be a franchise of sorts. Cheers to Greg Rucka for the splendid tale and the gritty performance of Furiosa or should I say Andy!"

Charlize Theron proved that Atomic Blonde was no fluke and that she's a natural bad-ass.

I'm convinced that The Old Guard benefits massively from a bit of \"absence makes the heart grow fonder\" - with zero theatrical releases for more than three months, competence takes on the appearance of distinction to moviegoers. A personal scruple, the film kicks off early with Theron gifting a \"first-edition Don Quixote\" to one of her comrades, presenting a book that couldn't be more than 150 years old. For a premise based on historical grounds, you'd think there would be a bit more attention to detail, especially early on when that premise is being established. (2.5/5)"

    "review": "I should begin this review by commending the inclusiveness of this globe-trotting actioner, which borrows some of the same-old tricks in an original story based on the graphic novel series by Greg Rucka. It isn't often that an out and proud same-sex couple are among the primary characters and are given the central romance in a film belonging to this genre. I read that Greg Rucka's contract with Skylance Media stipulated that a major scene highlighting the romance between the two men from the comic book must appear in the film adaptation. In addition, Skylance Media hired Gina Prince-Bythewood to direct this film, making her the first black woman to direct a big-budget (about $70M) comic book film. Wunderbar. More of this please, writers and studios! Being based on new material, The Old Guard does take its central plot featuring a covert team of mercenaries with a special and secret ability to some pretty interesting places. This, together with the pacing of the film and the confidence and control exuded by the versatile Charlize Theron in the lead role, always ensures The Old Guard is both solidly entertaining and is in steady hands. All that holds the film back from ever really becoming better than good is its execution in various areas. Let's start with the action sequences; these appear to be very well choreographed, but the cinematography work doesn't allow any of them to stand-out or be particularly memorable. The music added to many of these scenes add funk, but simultaneously made me feel as though I were watching a violent music video. I was honestly expecting Rihanna or Beyonce to pop out for a cameo at any moment! Though original, the storyline's trajectory can be quite foreseeable. And finally, Harry Potter actor Henry Melling's casting and performance as this film's main antagonist did not work at all for me."

This is a prime example of Hollywood providing too much social commentary and too little believability. Even if a movie is classed as fantasy, I should still feel a real connection to the characters. I should believe in them, their motives, their goals and their struggle. I felt nothing but disappointment. TL;DR Cool concept, dreadful execution."

    "review": "Best action movie I have seen in a damn long time. Very well put together background story that slowly gets revealed throughout the movie. Interesting and very unique plot, with a solid twist you don't see coming until shortly before it is revealed. All with fantastic fast paced action scenes and solid acting. Rarely do you see an action film so we'll out together. I hope and pray Netflix makes a sequel!!!"

The final let open for a lots of possible outcomes in the next movies and also it would be nice to have a movie telling some old histories of them or even a series of episodes wich would be nice."
