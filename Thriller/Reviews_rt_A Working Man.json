    "review": "A Working Man (2025) Deserved a Better Edition Since It Is Overlong (11,698 ‚Äì17 May 2025 ‚Äì by Claudio Carvalho) In Chicago, the former British military Levon Cade (Jason Statham) works at a construction company as foreman. He has a daughter, Merry Cade (Isla Gie), that is under the custody of his father-in-law Dr. Jordan Roth (Richard Heap), who hates him since Levon‚Äôs wife committed suicide. He considers the owner of the construction company, Joe Garcia (Michael Pe√±a), his wife Carla (Noemi Gonzalez) and their daughter Jenny (Arianna Rivas) as his family. When Jenny completes the first semester of her university, she celebrates with her friends in a bar. Out of the blue, the Russian traffickers Viper (Emmett J Scanlan) and Artemis (Eve Mauro) kidnaps her. The police do not find any clue to Jenny and Joe and Carla offer US$ 70,000.00 to Levon to find Jenny, but he refuses. He visits his blind friend Gunny Lefferty (David Harbour), who lives with his wife in the woods, and he says that Levon should help Joe‚Äôs family. Now Levon goes to the bar where Jenny was to look for evidence. Then he follows the bartender Johnny (David Witts) to his home to learn what happened to Jenny, and soon he learns that the Russian mafia is involved, in the beginning of the dangerous journey of Levon to rescue Jenny. ‚ÄúA Working Man‚Äù (2025) is an action movie by David Ayer with Jason Statham, presently the best actor of action films. The plot is unoriginal, with the ‚Äúhero‚Äù helping his friends to retrieve their daughter that was abducted by Russian mobsters but is also too long with almost 2 hours running time (1 h 56 min to be more precise). Consequently, there are a great number of gangsters with Russian names difficult to recall sometimes who is who. One question, why after rescuing Jenny, Levon leaves the powerful weapon provided by Gunny on the pool table to be burnt? My vote is six.

With a script that seems culled from the worst of the straight to vhs movies, 90s cliched bad guys and B movie cinematography: nothing works. Absolute stinker, no one involved should work again ( possible exemption for Arianna Rivas). Avoid."

The plot needed to be more gritty, but like the last few its almost as if they are trying to lighten the situation outside of the action scenes, not in what they are saying just in the style they are portrayed."

    "review": "Jason Statham reunites with director David Ayer in *A Working Man*, a gritty action-thriller that delivers the expected punches but stumbles in its execution. Statham portrays Levon Cade, a former Royal Marine turned construction worker, who is thrust back into a world of violence when his boss's daughter is kidnapped. The film attempts to blend high-octane action with emotional depth, exploring themes of redemption and fatherhood. While the action sequences are intense and showcase Statham's prowess, the film suffers from a disjointed narrative and underdeveloped characters. Critics have noted that the movie \"falls short due to a disjointed and inconsistent narrative\" , and that it \"lacks urgency and coherence\" . Despite these shortcomings, some viewers may appreciate the film's attempt to delve deeper into its protagonist's psyche. In summary, \"A Working Man\" offers the familiar thrills of a Statham-led action film but doesn't quite rise above its genre conventions."

That was a bit of a departure and I liked the extra dimension to the character. It seemed like a poor mans John Wick in parts and didn't seem to know what it was aiming for. There were lots of unbelievable parts of the plot and we did a lot of 'That's ridiculous' and 'That would never happen'. Emmet Scanlon, a respected actor in the UK , played a bumbling idiot and his dialogue was B movie. David Harbour was under used and the character added very little to the plot. I usually like Jason Statham movies and the plots are usually good, but not this one. I missed it at the cinema and watched it on streaming. So pleased I hadn't bought a cinema ticket."

But the story? Ultra generic. It's like we've all seen this stuff before: kidnapped daughter, ex-military dad, Russian bad guys, blah blah. The tone kept changing from serious to ridiculous, and the villains were just sort of. present. Even the good supporting cast like Michael Pe√±a and David Harbour didn't get much to do. Not bad if you only want some punch-kick-boom entertainment, but don't expect anything new or memorable. Good fights, forget the rest."

A Working Man feels mostly the same, with Jason seemingly playing the same hidden badass character‚Äîagain. It retains all the same problems as before: bad writing, dumb dialogue, forgettable characters, and overly cartoonish villains. David has certainly learned nothing from the previous movie. What makes this one worse, though, is that there are too many characters, too many villains, and the movie is just too long. It does have some fun action set pieces, but that‚Äôs really all it has."

    "review": "I was a HUGE FAN of The Beekeeper for it's B-Tier Cheesey Action & Antics, and Taken is \"One Of My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE Action Movies Of All Times\". Unfortunately, that doesn't guarantee you'll enjoy this film that is essentially those two films roled into one. This film struggles to balance the \"Campy Style\" with \"Serious Action\". The script itself could have used a few more drafts, especially with plot beats that feel like they're going no where and dialogue that is hard to follow at points. Also, Jason Statham's character and the girl he is trying to save both have WAY TOO MUCH PLOT ARMOR!!! At points, it seems like the bullets are swerving around him when he's in a narrow field of sight for the bad guys to shoot him, and if you remember what they said in Taken about the time-table with trafficing women, this girl should already be LONG GONE or DEAD. She's taken on a Friday night, and for some odd reason her family waits until Monday Morning to ask their friend for help, knowing his skill set. At other points, the girl pulls stunts that should be getting her executed on the spot, especially when it's established that the group owns a Clean-Up Crew, but they have to wait till late at night to try and take her far away to put her down, giving Levon Cade plenty of time to save her. Some have stated this might have worked better as a mini-series on TV and I have to agree with them. This movie isn't making me want to head straight back to see it again, and the more I think about it, the more problems I find with it. The action is still cool, and there's some funny moments here and there, but they also constantly set up moments that don't go where they CLEARLY SHOULD GO, Including with Levon's daughter. You can wait to stream this or just skip it all together. C+ & 6.2/10"

    "review": "What did I just watch? Ok firstly the positives. I‚Äôve seen all the Statham movies from transporter 1 to 10. I always loved him. I‚Äôm the guy who watched big trouble in little China, escape from New York and From dusk till dawn. I loved these old cult movies. I always rated Statham movies 6 to 8 out of 10. They never John Wicked me and they never achieved cult status, even though he‚Äôs actually not that bad an actor (good for an action British actor) and his combat sequences are always top notch. However for this particular movie: The negatives are far too many to mention. However I‚Äôll try, Spoilers: They brought in a 15 year old born in 2010 and said ‚Äòwrite me a good Statham action movie‚Äô but the script was 5/10. So then they brought in an 8 year old writer born in 2017 and said not contrived and not enough cheese, make it more predictable. Then this 3-4/10 was created. You know the plot and the story from the moment Jason is working as a foreman, site manager after the first 10 minutes. You have seen this movie 10,000 times over and over. It‚Äôs Taken, it‚Äôs every Hollywood action movie. In fact it‚Äôs so cheesy, predictable and contrived you will be rolling your eyes all the way through it. However as previously mentioned the action scenes are pretty good. There fairly brutal - but John Wick and Rambo from the 1980‚Äôs and Arnies Predator did it better. In fact I would go as far as to say this movie is cheesier than predator. Let me help you understand ‚Ä¶ Jason works as a foreman / site manager in construction. He ex special forces except he‚Äôs not special he‚Äôs an elite - a Royal Marines ex soldier. Royal Marines are not super men, they are human beings. I promise you. I was a real life paratrooper and the paratrooper in this (the coloured dude) hasn‚Äôt got a chance against the god that is Jason Statham the man who can take down any human or any super hero or villain in any time scale anywhere any how. He‚Äôs stronger than Thor. He‚Äôs faster than Spider-Man ‚Ä¶. He‚Äôs just a man guys üòù Just because your an ex royal marine (the elite land force of the navy) doesn‚Äôt mean you can take down an entire Russian mafia ring, alive for generations. Then they steal the plot from Taken. Stealing from Liam Neesons movie script. Then comes the Rodger rabbit villain or mask villain equipped with gold and black skull cane with glowing red eyes who dresses like a vampire. I‚Äôm not 6 I‚Äôm 43 (lol / lmfao). Then comes the elite mafia 2 ex con millennials. One female who has tattoos and looks like a marvel villain who just pushes and bullies an 18/22 year old kidnapped kid. Her partner another weak ass millennial with a ‚Äòcool modern haircut‚Äô is a little wuss with a gun who traded his recent star bucks job for a evil ST kidnapper. Jason breathes on them and they explode (lmfao). Then cue the 2 elite elite villains after the coloured ex paratrooper is murdered in 2 mins by Jason. The 2 elite villains ‚Ä¶ I was peeing my sides at this point. One looks like a crack head with a GPMG (large general purpose machine gun or Russian looking origin) and a shiny Gary glitter coat, whose gun is bigger than he is. The other is uncle festa from the Adams family with an M203 grenade launcher / assault rifle type from a call of duty video game. The guys who wrote / directed this clearly have no clue on actual military background / experience or training. They would have been better coming to me for advice on this (lol) or at least someone with 1 years military experience for tips. Lol I bet even Jason was laughing at the script surely Jason is a human being who knows a tiny ounce about the military. Anyway in short ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs unbelievably cliche / contrived / and cheese pie on a stick at the cheesy fair winning cheesy awards. Tell you what ‚Ä¶. If your bored have a drink get some mates round and have a good laugh. It‚Äôs probably that entertaining. As for me ‚Ä¶My GF fell asleep 5 mins in and I was left watching this tripe."

It's not just that the acting is wooden; it's that it feels like no one involved even read the script past page two. Stallone, wearing both the writer and producer hats, manages to deliver a screenplay so disjointed it makes a late-night infomercial look like The Godfather. The plot lurches from scene to scene with no logic or purpose, stitched together with tired tropes and dialogue that sounds like it was lifted from a parody. Jason Statham, normally a reliable presence in action roles, sleepwalks through the film like he‚Äôs counting down the minutes until he can fire his agent. Even the action scenes, which should at least be entertaining, are painfully staged and bizarrely edited‚Äîas if someone dared the crew to shoot everything in one take and call it a day. The costumes? Distracting. The tone? All over the place. The end result? A film that confuses volume with intensity and pacing with chaos. This isn‚Äôt just a bad movie.

The story has no ambition and the plot is nothing more than mediocre at best as it abandons the expectations it sets for the audience by becoming more about forcing its way to a solution rather than earning it even after the opening scenes show much promise to what viewers might see. Clearly this genre of action is getting noticeably tiresome in just a span of 5-10 years."

Ngl though, it felt unnecessarily long for a movie that should have gotten it over with fast. Nonetheless, 'A WORKING MAN' brings back the charming Jason Statham in all his masculinity and splendor delivering yet again, another action flick but at the expense of humor this time! This movie also limited the action with too much dialogues that should have been cut short, but Jason Statham's power house performance combined with David Ayer's impressive direction saved this movie from collapsing! It's worth the watch."

Wrath of man had far better plot, it stayed in the grey really well, and at least that was a revenge story for his son, this was a rescue mission for an acquaintance, just to do it, and at the same time put his real family in danger, and for some reason, the Russians had information that he had a daughter but never went for her to the school."

    "review": "Ahhh yes. The newest Jason Statham film in which he plays a former soldier/spy who tries to live a quiet life and escape his violent past; but gets drawn back in after somebody kills or kidnaps his loved one. Ladies and gentlemen this is A Working Man to a tee. Last year he was a Beekeeper, this year he‚Äôs a construction worker. In all seriousness, A Working Man is an ok film. It isn‚Äôt terrible like some folks are saying, there are bright spots in the film. But it does suffer from lackluster filmmaking that makes it very forgettable. It‚Äôs almost a perfect mixture that makes the film ok, kind of like mixing the weird drink combinations. You think it will taste bad, but it actually doesn‚Äôt taste that bad but you wouldn‚Äôt have it again. Starting with the performances, they were ok. The cast knew the roles they were given and just played their roles. Jason Statham does an ok job. He knows the assignment and what type of character to play so it worked for him in A Working Man. What also worked for the film was the action. The action in the film was fun. It was able to keep the viewers attention from when an action sequence began to when it ended. I will say out of all the recent Statham action films, this one I felt had the least amount. But it made up for it when the scenes came up. The last two aspects of the film to talk about in a combined manner is both the writing and runtime. The writing in the film is its biggest hindrance. It feels very first draft and you can tell because it hits every beat we see in any other action film. From the beginning of the film all the way to the end, you will guess almost everything that is going to happen. Which is fine, because you‚Äôre not going into this expecting Oscar worthy writing. But on the other hand, the writing could‚Äôve been tightened up because there is no way this film should clock in at 1hr and 56 minutes! It is crazy to me that this is almost a two hour film. But on the other hand, not really because it felt like it was almost 2 hours and was dragging along in the middle and towards the end. 25-30 minutes could‚Äôve been cut to have it by about 90 minutes. Overall, A Working Man is a serviceable action film. I wouldn‚Äôt say not to watch it, but I feel it‚Äôll be a watch when it hits streaming later in the spring than in theaters. But if there is one thing to take away from its release, it beat Snow White in its opening weekend. That‚Äôll be the description on the Blu-Ray copy."

    "review": "When I tell you about a movie where Jason Statham takes on human traffickers, you know exactly what you‚Äôre getting yourself into. The movie is A WORKING MAN, reuniting Statham and director David Ayers just one year after working together on THE BEEKEEPER, which I loved. Based on the book Levon‚Äôs Trade by Chuck Dixon, this tells the simple story of Levon Cade (Jason Statham), a former Royal Marine Commando who‚Äôs now a foreman of a construction company. He works for Joe Garcia (Michael Pe√±a) and his wife Carla (Noemi Gonzalez) and daughter Jenny (Arianna Rivas). Jenny gets‚Ä¶‚Ä¶taken‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and you know the rest. This movie tries to have a JOHN WICK approach to world-building, where there‚Äôs an underground network of baddies pulling the strings, but they cram way too many of them in. The further up the bad guy chain we go, the more cartoony they get. One guy literally looked like the Penguin with his top hat and sculpted cane. When the movie was leaning in on the silly fun pow bang boom that Statham is now known for, I was having lots of fun. Statham has this thing down to a science by now, but this one just feels more repetitive and generic than usual. For me, the sillier and more outlandish the better. Don‚Äôt take yourself too seriously. This is why I loved THE BEEKEEPER. This action movie might not be unique enough for me these days, but I still had myself a good time and I think you will too if you turn your brain off. There are more books that A WORKING MAN is based on, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we see Statham‚Äôs Levon Cade again."

If the movie was 20 minutes less I think it would have been better... It's too long, I was waiting for it to be over.

The plot had all of these opportunities to be really good as well as the cinematography had the potential to be really good, but neither were great. The plot was just a mix of a bunch of angry Russians and human trafficking, mostly filmed in dark alleys or dark clubs. You can only have so many under lit scenes before it all starts blending together. The best part of the movie was the dialog and interaction the main character has with his daughter. Three stars may be generous, but there was some fun dialog. Visually though, it was underwhelming and just a lot of dark and shadowy scenes."

With a Royal Marine Commando background, said organization and others (affiliated biker gang) don't stand a chance as he stabs, shoots, drowns, blows up, and neck snaps anyone in front of him. Some may argue that it's the same story, different profession (construction foreman), and they're probably right, but this action hero has achieved spellbinding status at this point and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it!!!"

    "review": "**2/5 - Statham Deserved Better** As a longtime Statham fan, I went in hoping for another gritty ride like *The Beekeeper*‚Äîwhich, while not perfect, at least had some sting. *The Working Man* (ironic title for how lazy the script felt) plays like a discount *Taken* knockoff, with none of the urgency or emotional pull. The plot's thinner than a gas station sandwich, and I‚Äôve seen more compelling villains in a Saturday morning cartoon. Every henchman felt ripped from a ‚Äúbad guy starter pack.‚Äù I don‚Äôt mind a brainless action flick now and then, but this one didn‚Äôt even try to entertain. Not asking for Shakespeare here, but at least give me a reason to care who‚Äôs getting punched. Even Statham, usually a reliable tough guy anchor, felt wasted. By the third act, I was more invested in checking the time than in any character‚Äôs fate. File this under \"forgettable.\""
