      "review": "A masterful, original and captivating film that from scene one clicked for me. While this is mostly a horror film, it also blends in a lot of other genres like comedy and musical in a great way. The setpieces are very entertaining and well crafted, but this film also has a lot of thematic weight and undertones that i thought was explored in a clever, powerful and subdued kind of way. Michael B. Jordan kills it in his dual performance, and i also though the rest of the cast did a solid job. The editing is elegant, the score is inducing eargasm and the visual palette is beautiful. I just love Ryan Coogler's filmmaking style. You can tell how much this film meant to him and the passion is felt through every frame. In the overcrowded field of franchise movies, remakes, reboots and whatnot, this is the type of film we need more of. The only minor nitpick i have with this movie is the final shot, which didn't do too much for me. I am not saying that it is bad by any means, but it didn't hit me as much i had hoped. Overall, a fantastic and highly enjoyable movie with a fair amount of well-presented subtext that i strongly recommend checking out. This movie is a reminder to the wonderment that film can produce."

Great acting, sets, cars, costuming. Coulda been a great story about a coupla black brothers returning South to open up a blues club bankrolled by money stolen from Capone. Talented actors, good chemistry, and a great set and a movie with a vibe ruined by inserting vampire nonsense into it. Take the same actors and set, even the director, and do it over. Develop the relationships within the cast, play way more blues music, integrate the racial tensions of the time (without over doing it), you had the feel and the character of the integrated south and its tensions nailed.=, then went stupid. This was a story meant to be based on the reality of the time and the Blues Culture - not goddamned vampires."

I drove from Houston to Dallas to view it in IMAX 2D 70mm. I must say, the 3-1/2hr trip was worth it. I felt so immersed in the movie even after this being my 3rd viewing. It felt new and rejuvenated with the new visuals I was getting. I honestly wish this format was around for a lot of other films. It sucks that I could only experience it with this film once. Nonetheless I will cherish the crisp colors and depth of detail on the characters when it entered the 1:43:1 aspect ratio. It's an immersion I've never experienced with cinema in 35yrs."

The performances are nothing short of soul-baring each character carved from flesh, bone, and buried regret. You don‚Äôt watch Sinners, you feel it, deep in your being. The cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, capturing pain and silence with reverence. The writing is sharp and unflinching, laced with spiritual tension and moral ambiguity that leaves you reflecting long after the credits roll. Run to see this movie, especially in 70mm IMAX."

More than a film, Sinners is a mirror‚Äîboldly reflecting the buried traumas and enduring strength of Black America. Jordan‚Äôs performance is raw and riveting, carrying a generational weight that never feels forced. Coogler‚Äôs direction transforms symbolic imagery‚Äîbaptismal water, fractured stained glass, the pulpit and the prison‚Äîinto poetic language. Each frame breathes with historical memory and present-day urgency. Rather than spoon-feed its audience, Sinners trusts us to sit in discomfort and revelation. For Black viewers, especially, it speaks directly and powerfully: a cinematic sermon that interrogates systems of sin and survival. Coogler doesn‚Äôt just tell a story‚Äîhe resurrects one. Without question, Sinners stands as one of the most meaningful cinematic achievements of the decade."

I go back to the movie soundtrack constantly because that‚Äôs how much of a role the music played in the movie."

However, I think the director took too many liberties with what we have know for years about vampires, their strengths and weakness, no way the twin would have been able to best his vampire twin as the vampire is always stronger than a human. I think the story took too long to get to the action and was very slow and dull, also there were many more vampires than humans by the end of the movie so how the player survived was just not very believable."

The fight choreography is a highlight‚Äîbrutal, fast-paced, and beautifully shot. But what really elevates Sinners is its commitment to character. Each member of the ensemble feels distinct and layered, with motivations that make the drama hit just as hard as the violence. The world-building is sharp and creative, offering a new spin on vampire lore without feeling forced or gimmicky. There are a few pacing hiccups here and there, but overall the direction keeps things moving with confidence and energy. It‚Äôs stylish without being hollow, and fun without losing emotional stakes. A solid 4-star experience that proves there's still plenty of life left in the vampire genre when it's done right. Definitely worth a watch."

Jacob did a great job of introducing the movie and the IMAX/70mm technology, and thank you Dick for flying in from England! My only complaints was that the sound was a little quiet and that the film was a little dim, but those could just be me unaccustomed to 70mm film (it was my first time seeing it). There were also a few dust/specks flying down the screen towards the end of the movie, but I also think its part of the technology. Thanks for having such a cool theater and screen available to the public!"

The acting was phenomenal‚Äîevery performance felt raw, real, and deeply human. The cast delivered with intensity and subtlety, making it easy to connect with the characters on every level. It wasn‚Äôt just a movie‚Äîit was an experience. Seeing it in 70mm elevated every scene, every emotion, and every nuance of this beautifully told story.

You will get 15 more minutes worth of movie which could be an opening for a Sinners 2. A lot of people walked out and missed it. Now on to the review. I haven‚Äôt seen movie reviews this good in a long time. You would think this movie will be a catalyst for world peace the way reviewers were talking. I went in skeptical because 99.9% of the time they are wrong. Well, this is the .1% they are correct. Visually stunning, well acted (Michael B. Jordan plays dual roles as the Smokestack twins and actually does it well), an original storyline and a killer soundtrack if you like blues music. The first act of the film is in no hurry to get to the second act. It‚Äôs when characters are introduced before heading towards the part of the movie you are waiting for. It‚Äôs necessary for the viewer to actually develop feelings for the characters. The movie merges the past, present, and future through music. In today‚Äôs political climate some may have problems with the honest portrayal of black history and its reality. It‚Äôs a shame I have to bring it up. Reviewers say this is the best movie of the year. I have to agree and I will raise it. This movie is an epic masterpiece and will be a classic. Oh yeah‚Ä¶. and there are vampires. Get your tickets now. This movie deserves to have Barbie numbers in ticket sales and I will be watching!"

      "review": "This was a strange watch. The storyline and character development felt patchy- really thorough in some cases and massive gaps in others. For example if you‚Äôre going to make the opening seem like the whole movie is centred around Preachers special ability why barely address this in the film? The musical scene that tried to depict this was a good start but not enough to walk away with a clear understanding. I still don‚Äôt really get what his special ability was other than the literal dialogue. Could have been a larger part of the plot line. I feel like the slow build up of suspense was lacking for a film classified as thriller/horror. The first 2/3 of the movie felt like a meaningful timepiece drama and the final 3rd felt like it was an entirely different film. The vampires themselves felt more like satire than actual feared characters. Especially the twin. He was too likeable and familiar as someone meant to be feared. More work needed to be done to break down all of the rapport we built with him through out the film before trying to make us see him as a villain. The automation of the weapons/ modernisation of the gun violence felt out of place for the period. The use of electric guitar scores in crucial moments also fits with the above. Didn‚Äôt feel like it fit in for the time period. Plus the closing KKK scene felt like a desperate attempt to draw deeper meaning at the end. Instead just came off as a stereotypical shoot out scene trying to wear the dress of a deeper message. Overall poorly done. Foundations were there but fell massively short and all of the raving reviews make me wonder if we watched the same film."

Eles resolvem abrir um clube de blues para a comunidade negra local, por√©m um mal mais antigo est√° √† espreita. Ryan Coogler est√° se tornando uma das vozes negras mais potentes no cinema americano. Depois de continuar a franquia Rocky, criando uma nova com o filho do Apolo Creed e fazer um dos melhores filmes de super-her√≥is, apresentando o Pantera Negra, dando um grande destaque a ele, Coogler nos traz um filme de vampiros, mas com uma leitura social extremamente importante. Aqui ele retorna aos anos 30. O mundo tinha sa√≠do de uma guerra, mas logo entraria em outra. Sementes come√ßavam a ser plantadas referentes aos direitos negros em uma regi√£o extremamente preconceituosa e atrasada. O clube dos irm√£os Smoke e Stack √© um lugar de celebra√ß√£o da cultura negra, como na cena mais famosa do filme, onde o personagem de Miles Caton se apresenta e se torna um gri√¥, abrindo portas para o passado e futuro, onde a m√∫sica e a dan√ßa se misturam em √©pocas e estilos diferentes. Mas tamb√©m a cultura asi√°tica √© homenageada. J√° √© uma das cenas mais belas e fortes desse ano. Mas al√©m de ser um local de celebra√ß√£o, √© um local de resist√™ncia. Os vampiros representam n√£o somente a amea√ßa √†quele grupo de pessoas, mas tamb√©m uma amea√ßa √† liberdade que eles constru√≠ram naquele lugar, naquela noite. √â muito interessante fazer uma rela√ß√£o entre a tradi√ß√£o que um vampiro tem que receber a permiss√£o do dono da casa para poder entrar e os negros n√£o terem o direito de entrar em todos os lugares. Ou de haver lugares separados para eles. E ao serem mordidos e transformados em vampiros, os negros perdiam sua identidade, tornando-se um s√≥ com o personagem de Jack O'Connell, como na cena onde uma roda se forma em torno dele e todos cantam aquela can√ß√£o irlandesa, como se falasse a todos eles igual. Outro ponto extremamente positivo √© a trilha sonora e as can√ß√µes se encaixam perfeitamente bem, quase tornando o filme um musical, onde blues, country e can√ß√µes tradicionais se misturam, unindo-se nos seus pontos comuns. Al√©m do estilo de Coogler ser bastante percept√≠vel, √© claro que conseguimos ver influ√™ncias de Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino e Jordan Peele. O interessante √© que o filme ocorre em um √∫nico dia, da compra da serraria pelos g√™meos, at√© o nascer do outro dia. Apenas um dia pode ser fugaz, mas aqui foi eterno. Parab√©ns, Ryan Coogler."

I wad expecting more tension and I very much believe that there are moments that would have hit harder if the trailers hadn't shown them, which is a little annoying. I also don't think movie has a lot of rewatches in it for me which also marks it down a bit but definitely keen to watch it once or twice more"

A 1932 dance hall scene of black dancers are all of a sudden intertwined with a weird set of dancers with modern day masks and costumes...huh? It's 1932 and all of a sudden someone is using modern day weaponry. Maybe I'm not cool but I didn't understand a word they were saying. I'm not sure who was the intended audience for this movie."

Side note: It is 137 minutes long so I did subtract half a star. Stay past the first set of credits. There is a hidden scene."
