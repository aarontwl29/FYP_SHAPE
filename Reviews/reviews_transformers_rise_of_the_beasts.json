      "review": "(CASTELLANO) No reinventa nada, pero s√≠ consigue lo que muchas pel√≠culas del g√©nero ni se molestan en intentar: entretener de principio a fin. Transformers: El despertar de las bestias se mueve al ritmo de la acci√≥n casi sin pausa, con una energ√≠a que no decae y que consigue que las dos horas se pasen volando. Es puro blockbuster, sin complejos. A diferencia de entregas anteriores, aqu√≠ se nota cierta intenci√≥n de dar algo m√°s de peso emocional. No es que sea una pel√≠cula dram√°tica, ni mucho menos, pero s√≠ tiene algunos momentos tristes que sorprenden por lo bien colocados que est√°n en medio del caos. Y eso, en una saga acostumbrada al ruido por el ruido, se agradece. Visualmente est√° al nivel que se espera de una superproducci√≥n de este calibre: efectos espectaculares, batallas enormes y una puesta en escena que saca todo el partido a los Transformers. Adem√°s, la ambientaci√≥n noventera y la banda sonora con toques de hip hop a√±aden personalidad y un punto nost√°lgico que funciona bastante bien. ¬øEs predecible? Por supuesto. ¬øEst√° llena de clich√©s? Tambi√©n. Pero lo cierto es que funciona. Y parte de eso se debe a un reparto que cumple con creces, con Anthony Ramos y Dominique Fishback aportando humanidad a una historia dominada por m√°quinas. Puede que no sea la mejor de la franquicia, pero s√≠ es una de las m√°s equilibradas. Sabe lo que quiere ser y no se anda con rodeos. Acci√≥n, espect√°culo, y un par de detalles emocionales bien colocados. A veces, eso basta. (ENGLISH) It doesn‚Äôt reinvent the wheel, but it does manage something many blockbusters don‚Äôt even try: to entertain from start to finish. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts moves at full speed, with non-stop action and energy that never dips. It‚Äôs unapologetic popcorn cinema at its best. Unlike some previous entries, this one actually tries to inject a bit more emotional weight. It‚Äôs not a tearjerker by any means, but there are a few surprisingly touching moments that are well-placed amidst all the chaos. And for a franchise that usually goes all in on noise, that‚Äôs a welcome change. Visually, it delivers exactly what you'd expect from a big-budget production: spectacular effects, massive battles, and a scale that fully embraces the Transformers‚Äô potential. The ‚Äò90s vibe and the hip-hop-infused soundtrack give it extra flair and just the right dose of nostalgia. Is it predictable? Absolutely. Full of clich√©s? For sure. But it works. And a big part of that is thanks to a cast that brings heart to the metal, especially Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback, who ground the story with some much-needed humanity. It might not be the best of the saga, but it‚Äôs one of the most balanced. It knows what it wants to be and doesn‚Äôt try to be anything else. Action, spectacle, and just the right touch of emotion. Sometimes, that‚Äôs all you need."

Rise of the beasts feels like it's much better quality, while the previous movies felt tacky. Really liked the story as it was simple but entertaining and the writing was really good. The characters were good fun and the villains were dark. It was a nice mix of drama and comedy with heaps of action. Which is all you really want from a movie about giant robots fighting each other."

      "review": "'Transformers: Rise of the Beasts' continues this franchise's fine tradition of (mostly) underwhelming me, though to be honest it does match predecessor 'Bumblebee' in at least making its plot more than just robots smashing into each other. I wouldn't file it under 'bad', to be fair. The brotherly bond between the characters of Anthony Ramos and Dean Scott Vazquez is this movie's best element, in my opinion. I found that to be touching, even if the film doesn't utilise it as much as it perhaps could have. Aside from those, Dominique Fishback is the best of the humans. As for the voices, Pete Davidson is good in this as Mirage - I think he might be my 'favourite' robot from this whole series. Davidson is lively in the role, amusing too. Peter Dinklage is a mini positive as well, even though I would've preferred if they didn't alter his usual voice as much. Looks like I am going to have to now watch the 'G.I. Joe' franchise at some point, at least that only has three flicks. Well, for now. I best be quick before they pump them out as quickly as 'Transformers' did."

The movie‚Äôs visuals feels a little more lazy, the plot is all over the place just like a Transformers movie usually is, and the characters that they decided to focus on were probably the most uninteresting of the bunch. The movie borrowed some concepts from other movies unashamedly, more inconsistencies plagued this one, and the characters they chose to focus on weren‚Äôt the most compelling of the cast.

Many have put bumblebee and the recent transformers one as the best but in my opinion I stand by as the first Michael bay directed film from 2007 as the best and considering because it was meant to be a modern 21st century blockbuster links pirates of the carribean and lord of the rings that is by far the best in terms of blockbuster standards. That original is way better than rise of the beasts. Rise of the beasts is stupid and souless and doesn‚Äôt deserve any love from those who find the franchise redeemable this is just another lackluster installment in this near inconsistent franchise overall I give the cartoon disguised as a live action snooze fest that is transformers rise of the beasts a 3/10"

The first is still a masterpiece, with Shia LaBeouf and ensemble cast around him setting the bar so high that no one has matched it since. In 2007 this was all very groundbreaking. But even then a tendency to have over long action sequences when literally nothing interesting happens. Bumble Bee with Hailee Steinfield was another high water mark. the tone and her star role make this a very memorable and re-weatchable film. I note that the producers felt Bumble bee lacked the big set action that audiences need, but for me, real human interactions and this more down to earth scale was really good and they should try and capture that again. So for 'Rise of the Beasts', allegedly an opportunity to combine the human scale of BB with human characters we care about. But unforunately the actors may well be good in this, but the script does not allow them to be truly witty and deep characters. It feels like mindless action rules again. The trailer looked promising, but I wont watch any more Transformers, unless strong witty human characters and more human real scale stories take centre stage again. This one is sadly such a missed opportunity."

Yet, it falters in replicating Michael Bay‚Äôs iconic style; its attempt at chaotic energy and relentless explosions feels like a disjointed imitation, lacking the immersive coherence Bay is known for. Set in 1994, the film introduces the Maximals, with Ron Perlman‚Äôs Optimus Primal leading a team that joins forces with the Autobots, headed by Peter Cullen‚Äôs Optimus Prime, to battle the planet-devouring Unicron. Peter Dinklage‚Äôs portrayal of Scourge adds a darkly humorous edge to the villain role, but it is Pete Davidson‚Äôs Mirage who stands out with his irreverent and hilarious voice work, injecting a vibrant comedic energy into the film. Michelle Yeoh‚Äôs Airazor and Cristo Fern√°ndez‚Äôs Wheeljack further enrich the character roster with their distinctive contributions. Human leads Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback deliver compelling performances as Noah Diaz and Elena Wallace, infusing the film with emotional depth and reinforcing themes of family and perseverance. Despite its impressive visuals and engaging performances, Rise of the Beasts struggles to leave a lasting impact, falling short of innovation while providing a satisfying, if conventional, adventure."

However, the film ultimately still suffers from horrible character development with the humans being forced into the situation without any personal connection to the story and with half of the autobots not being introduced or explained whatsoever. Another issue is the plot. It's just another \"save the artifact and save the world\" gig, with the ultimate bad guy, Unicron, having no motive other then to eat planets. Unicron doesnt even look cool. The pacing and action are better in this film than in the previous Transformers movies, this in the 21st century, that will only get you so many stars. I agree with other critics as well that the overall philosophy and code of ethics of the autobots is very unclear."

Again they do a better job at fleshing out the human characters & their motivation being involved in the story. Optimus prime has a good character arc & movie does a solid intro to the primals. They definitely borrowed designs for antagonists from Lord of the Rings. The soundtrack with heavy hip-hop from 90's was pretty dope & matched the vibe of the story. First 2 acts of movie swiftly with interesting set pieces, but slows down in the 3rd with a CGI heavy final act we are accustomed to in the past decade from blockbuster movies. However, I am genuinely interested in how they will continue to expand this storyline in the Hasbro universe they're building. Solid movie on a big screen."

The extended cave scene and a few of the extras scenes from the switchback alternate chase scene. The this can‚Äôt be real scene and maybe the transit scene and probably with some maximal scenes to explain why they remain in beast mode most of the time along with using airazor a spark as a bomb cut scene as well and maybe have those other three autobots that arrived on earth at the of the bumblebee movie with these autobots being maybe grimlock Ironhide and ratchet and maybe jazz sideswipe and some other well known autobots to show how many autobots arrived On earth during the seven years since bumblebee in maybe another post credit scene where like Optimus waiting in idk maybe Yellowstone or something for the rest of his autobots to meet up with him and wheeljack stratosphere arcee and bumblebee and when these other autobots I mentioned earlier arrive the camera does like a huge crowd shot scene showing autobots like (sorry if I‚Äôm repeating myself)[deep breath in] Ironhide grimlock drift Windblade ratchet Jazz sideswipe whirl warpath tailgate and some other well known autobots with laserbeak in the distance out of sight seeing this all happen through his head camera thing as a way to foreshadow the decepticons coming to earth now that would be a good post credit scene or a good ending cliffhanger.

Their were, boring fight sceans, bad CGI, awful dialog, bad music soundtrack, very bad human characters, and other wasted charecters (The only good characters were Bumblebee, Scourge, and Optimus Primal). Most of the movie the Maximals weren't in it, the beginning yes, we got like 10 minutes of them, then we go about an 1 hour without them, and the hawk one and Primal got to talk most, the cheeta had one line, the rhino didn't talk at all, and I here they didn't add a character named Rattrap. The Movie Is Called 'RISE OF THE BEASTS' FOR A REASON!!! Why did they have such little screan time!!! Also, Optimus Prime was so out of character this whole movie. He hated humans, acted like a terrible leader, he didn't value others lives except Bumblebee, he didn't give hope or wisdom to his friends just kept them in doubt, he was still brutal (People say he isn't in this movie but that ain't true \"I'm going to take away his key, then his head\". Thats just a sensored version of \"I'm getting that key then ripping off you head!\" Then later he grabs Scourge and slams his face in lava until it starts to melt, and when Scouge breaks free Optimus Prime cuts his arms off, stabs him in the head and rips his head off, and his robot spine is still connected to his head. HOW IS THAT NOT BRUTAL!?) And his design is garbage as well. They focused too much on the humans and it was sooooooo boring, the human sceans in other movies were funny and/or interesting, but this movie had awful sceans with humans. It was garbage scean to more garbage. Thier was only one good scean of the hole movie and that was Bumblebee's return scean."

However, these positives get buried under a heap of negatives: ‚Ä¢ Rehashed Plot: The story offers little that's new or inventive, relying on familiar beats and predictable plot twists. ‚Ä¢ Shallow Characters: Both the human characters and the Transformers themselves lack depth or development, making it hard to connect with them. ‚Ä¢ Nostalgia Overload: The film leans heavily on references to past Transformers films, which might feel pandering to some viewers. ‚Ä¢ HORRIBLE ACTING, DIRECTION and WRITING !!! ‚Ä¢ Forgettable Experience: Despite the big visuals and action, the film fails to leave a lasting impression. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts might appeal to die-hard Transformers fans looking for a visual spectacle.

Even though this was not a direct sequel to Bumblebee, I was hoping that they would take that's movies strengths and apply them to this movie, but sadly it feels like the only thing that got carried over was the Generation 1 paintjob and that is about it. But it is not from a lack of trying. You can see that they wanted to re-create what Charlie had with Bumblebee with Mirage and Noah, but the spark isn't there this time around. Mirage is more unlikable than Bumblebee due to his comedic attempts landing flat and all around irritating nature. Noah is forgettable from both a writing and performance standpoint compared to Charlie. Noah's lone wolf to team player narrative is also not as interesting to watch. Elana is also pretty forgettable and is only really there for the plot. The Maximals and the Terrocons are interesting enough additions to the mythology and do a serviceable job. The action is what you expect from one of these movies, however the third act seems way too over the top and has a few too many dumb ideas (Such as multiple death fake outs that become deus ex machinas). I am really not a fan of the proposed \"Hasbro Cinematic Universe\" teased during this final act and overall, it felt like it was losing steam as the film went along, throwing many ideas at the board and seeing what stuck. At 2 hours, it really started to drag towards the end. Overall, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a disappointment and I can only hope that the next entry is better."

No meio disso, surgem os Maximals, transformers que adotaram a forma de animais. Este filme √© uma sequ√™ncia de Bubblebee que deu um restart na franquia, depois que ela se perdeu em efeitos especiais e hist√≥rias sem p√© nem cabe√ßa. O filme tem muitos acertos. Primeiro, diminuiu o n√∫mero de personagens humanos, ficando praticamente reduzidos a Noah, um jovem ladr√£o que cai de para-quedas na hist√≥ria, e Elena, a respons√°vel pela descoberta da chave. Esta obsess√£o de colocar personagens humanos nafranquia dos Trasnformers, acabavam por tornar os rob√¥s em coadjuvantes da sua pr√≥pria hist√≥ria. Aqui, eles assumem o protagonismo. Outro ponto positivo √© o CGI, s√£o muito bons, a transforma√ß√£o dos rob√¥s em carro e vice-versa s√£o mais claros e vemos para onde vai cada parte do carro. Com isso, as sequ√™ncias de a√ß√£o tornaram-se claras, com poucas edi√ß√µes, tornando claro e compreens√≠vel toda a tomada. Por√©m, com todas essas melhoras, ainda h√° alguns pontos negativos, como a toda hora o roteiro ter que achar uma desculpa para colocar os personagens humanos na a√ß√£o. Ou mesmo a quantidade de rob√¥s usados. Enquanto o grupo do Optimus Prime, praticamente, todos os personagens tem sua personalidade desenvolvida, no caso dos Maximals, tirando o Optimus Primal e a Airazor, os outros integrantes n√£o disseram para o que vieram. A mesma coisa pode se aplicar √† equipe dos vil√µes. Apenas Scourge tem um certo desenvolvimento, os outros s√£o mais capangas com algumas frases. Apesar do roteiro acertar em alguns detalhes, ele peca em n√£o causar medo ou preocupa√ß√£o da amea√ßa de Unicron para os espectadores. No final, √© um filme que perde em compara√ß√£o com Bubblebee, mas √© muito melhor em compara√ß√£o com a s√©rie anterior. Quem sabe no pr√≥ximo filme, eles retirem de vez os humanos como participantes da hist√≥ria, deixando apenas os rob√¥s como os √∫nicos personagens."

I think Bumblebee might have been better than this, but I don't intend to watch it again to find out because I didn't think it was all that good either. I could have just watched the awesome 80s animated film again. I think in some ways, Beast Wars the tv show has aged better than this film ever will. I'm not really sure why they included so many characters that I remember only to either change their personalities completely (wheeljack, mirage) or reduce them to almost entirely non-speaking parts (cheetor, rhinox). So much of the plot focuses on the humans for some reason, but they just aren't at all interesting. The acting is fine, but if you have no script to work with there's only so much you can do. There were explosions and action, but it all felt very CGI-hollow to me. There was‚Ä¶ pretty much no explanation of who the Maximals were unless I missed it other than \"we're from you're future and you're past\" well okay, I'm not sure who you talking to‚Ä¶ not enough for fans and not enough for people who don't know what the heck you're on about. How the ever living hell does this have such a high audience rating? This is honestly just as bad as many of the DC super hero films that get (rightfully) slammed and far worse than some of those. I felt this was way worse than the panned Flash movie. Oh well. This is the kind of film that might be good to have on in the background while you do something like clean your room. But even then, there's gotta be something better right?"

Aqui como terr√°queo amigo dos Autobots temos Anthony Ramos e Dominique, antes tivemos Shia LaBeouf e Megan que estiveram o 1¬∫, 2¬∫ e 3¬∫ mas aqui sai Megan e entra Rosie (aqui foi uma das grandes mancadas de Megan na sua carreira) e depois temos Mark Wahlberg 4¬∫, 5¬∫ em Bumblebee temos Hailee Steinfeld 6¬∫. Grandes nomes e agora temos o menos conhecido Ramos e Dom trazendo um latino e uma afro. A grande novidade aqui s√£o os animais Maximals que para trazer um diferencial com os Dinossauros. Oque vir√° no prossimo? Animais aqu√°ticos ou Kaiju ou os Jiggers (C√≠rculo de Fogo) ou Godzilla ou King Kong. Hoje em dia nada √© imposs√≠vel. Pois j√° tivemos Alien e Predador, Jason e Fredy,... qual a maior aposta? Mas aqui mais uma vez a Terra esta a ponto de ser destru√≠da por um devorador de mundos. Que precisa de um artefato que os Maximals esconderam anos atr√°s. Mas que agora a amea√ßa esta de volta. E teremos Optimos Prime e toda a sua equipe mais MAximals para lutar e salvar a Terra. O ar de comico continua sendo uma de suas marcas com aquelas piadas for√ßadas. Os efeito s√£o bons como em toda s√©rie, trazendo um realismo na fic√ß√£o. Roteiro e enredo a receita √© a mesma, com caras diferentes. Uma franquia que j√° tem 16 anos com 7 filmes, j√° esta atingindo novos f√£s. Vale apena assistir?

Having it follow on from the joyful Bumblebee (seems a few folks missed that it was following that, not the previous films) made so much more sense, and yet again this feels more like a film made by someone who actually likes Transformers rather than someone who wants robots for their action movie. Anthony Ramos Jnr, is great as always."

Michael Bay has a place film, but his interpretation of the TF IP was wildly over the top with storylines that focused on the wrong thing - the humans. TF I knew and loved wasn't about an unnecessary love story/interest/drama/triangle or father/daughter rescue storyline...it was about, erhm, the friggin TRANSFORMERS!! I stayed away from any/all installments from then on (including Bumblebee, which I've since rectified). Once I heard they were releasing a new TF movie in 2023 I groaned, but then I heard the name...could it be they finally introducing the Maximals!? I'd loved the show Beasts Wars when it was on, at the point of even being ridiculed by friends, so this was big. But also potentially yet another disaster. My disappointment from the Bay-era kept me from seeing Beasts while in theaters, but a fateful visit to my mom's house, courisority and a lazy afternoon led to a digital rental viewing experience. My expectations? Beyond low. My skepticism? Major. My momma? Ecstatic (shes loved every TF movie since 2007). Within the OPENING SCENE, I was already hopeful. It was them. The Maximals. Optiumus Primal. Wow. The special effects, voices. Everything, it was there (welp, except Rattrap) It only got better from the title screen - being set in the 90s allowed for a great prequel storyline (+epic music choices) and the ability to try and mend the pain of the overly-everything Bay-era. Probably would've made a few minor tweaks, but I legit laughed out loud mutilple times, arms-in-air cheered more than once and even teared up a few times. This movie gave me everything I didn't know I wanted or needed, and than gave me more with not 1 but 2 end credit scenes! To say I enjoyed it would be an understatement and ended up purchasing it once the rental expired. This movie was so good, I ended up watching the entire franchise (all for the first time except the 2007 OG) which 1000% confirmed my belief the Bay-era was horrendous and franchise deserve better. Bumblebee started it, Beasts continued it and I am now excited and hopefully to see where it goes from here. Side note - This whole review might sound dramatic, but please believe I'm very serious, lol. If you've made it to the end, thanks for reading"

No more clumsy tumbling sloppy robots rolling around on the ground. No these transformers are very authentic and are way closer to the source material. I didn't think they could outdo the Bumble Bee spin off but it seems like they did? I don't like Rock or Rap music playing during action scenes in a movie, I like actual scores so the music placement could have been better. However theres not much for me to hate with this one. It's well worth the $5.99 to rent or buy ."

Obvs these to objectives are mutually exclusive but the ‚Äòwisdom' of the Beast Wars bots let's Optimus figure this out himself. The human story is actually pretty good with the two main characters developed enough despite minuscule exposition amongst all the transformers biz. Out of all the Transformers movie this is the closest to G1 cartoon series and 1984 Movie."

Why does it seem that whomever is making these films are purposely going out of their way to ignore all the source material? Go out of their way to change the design, and personalities of every Transformer? In some cases completely change the alt mode from one character to another. Why did Mirage have Jazz's alt mode? What they did to Wheeljack in this film, was inexcusable. I cannot think of any valid reason for them to do what they did to him. Especially after seeing how he could have looked from the Cybertron scene in Bumblebee. They have to know that everyone wants a movie, like what we saw in the first 10 minutes of Bumblebee. Why do they just refuse to do this? We want a G1 inspired franchise. They could create a whole universe from this source material. 1st movie, work on the origins of Prime and Megatron. Tell the story of why Megatron became the way he did. Then move on to the war of cybertron and then end that movie with them crashing on Earth a million year ago. 2nd movie. Start where the last ended, but in current times. They have been in stasis this whole time, but are awaken and repaired with alt modes from their surroundings (also don't allow them to just change their alt mode whenever it's convenient, what they have is what they get.) 3rd movie. This is where we could maybe introduce Unicron, basically this could be a modern retelling of the 84 movie. But don't introduce all the G2ish characters, don't need to see Blur. But Optimus really does die in this one, doesn't come back. Megatron is reformatted into Galvatron. Everyone they introduce needs character development or don't have them in the film. This could even be a 2 part film, to allow them time to develop and tell the story. 4th movie. A true Beast wars movie, starts off in the way distant future. They can explain how the Autobots and Decepticons are extinct and the maximals and predicons are the decendants. BW Megatron has always had greater ambitions and then learns about the golden disk with the message from Megatron. Basically now, a movie similar to the original BW show. This can all be done, and would at the same time build a universe of connected movies. But instead, we get the exact same film over and over and over (with apparently no connection to the movies that came out before it). New unneeded human characters find artifact. Meet random transformer, hunt for other artifacts. Human saves day. We are so tired of this garbage. Why they refuse to give us the movies we want is baffling."

The rap soundtrack mixed in with cinematic is kind of a strange choice and is very hit or miss. Especially during the action scenes the rap numbers seem out of place. The CGI is shotty with the Bird looking not tha good, oversaturation at the end fight, solid work on Prime, its a bit all over the place. Also the action scenes are very simliar to what weve seen before in all the other ones. It is jumpy a bit in the start, but settles down in the second half. The new autobots aren't used for much besides plot expose dumps every 20 minutes or so and lack much character. That also goes for the human characters who are just ok as well and follow the same beats Shia & Mark followed. It's nothing we haven't seen before in this franchise and done better. The digital scenes look out of place as well and feel like there from a entirely different movie. The end fight does drag a bit as well keeping up with tradition of the other sequels. This is better than those mainly because the excess and Bay tropes aren't present in this and this feels like a basic stripped down Transformers sequel but thats the main problem. It is predictable the entire way for the most part but is competant. If you wanna see giant robots fight again than you'll get your money. If your most and wanna see something different and not just a retelling of the first or previous ones again than skip this and stick with the first & Bumblebee."

This movie I believe is much more entertaining and action packed as Bumblebee was and has a much more complex story as it dives more into the lore of Transformers with the arc known as Beast Wars. This movie feels really similar to Revenge of the Fallen as it dives into that National Treasure or Indiana Jones feel of things. I also really enjoyed the dynamic between not only Mirage and Noah within the movie but more so Noah and Optimus as they do butt heads a little, realizing they have more in common than they think which I enjoy their dynamic better than Sam and Optimus, but Sam's dynamic with Bumblebee can't be beaten in my opinion. I found a lot of Mirage's jokes within the movie to be funny, mostly due to the fact I get a kick out of Pete Davidson as it is. I also really enjoyed how more accurate the transformers' designs were to the cartoons even though the Bay designs will always have a special place in my heart. I'm just so glad that Transformers is still showing that they have gas in the tank when it comes to the intense action that will give you suspense, make you engaged, and still deliver a great story. Overall, Rise of the Beasts is a great movie with a charming cast and has some great character development and chemistry while also keeping the action-packing and bringing back that adventure aspect to these movies. Rise of the Beasts is a B+."

However like all the Transformers movies it quickly devolves into dialogue that just doesn't make much sense. The transwarp this or that is going to be used by a bad guy to destroy this planet or that planet. It's it too much to ask for action packed intellectually engaging content? I guess if you make some thing and it's dumb, but it takes in the same out of money than why try? Most characters don't get enough screen time. Especially the maximals.

They spent effort making animated fight sequences, and just seem to play them back with some dull music background with no atmosphere - zero tension and maximum boredom. The acting is, at times, so painfully bad - it looks like they pulled some random teenagers from the street. It almost seems like there's an in-movie joke where one 'actor' says to the other 'actor' whilst pretending to push a heavy stone lid 'are you even pushing?'. Very good question, it looks like they put their hands on it, moved their bodies and scrunched up their faces. It never looked like they were really pushing it at all - I'm guessing they had to take care not to dislodge the polystyrene lid... I loved the first movie, and I really enjoyed seeing Bumblebee's movie - but that's it."

Secondly, I understand Optimus Prime is supposed to have \"grown\" throughout this film into who he is as we know him in the future movies.. but Optimus Prime has never once ever come across petty and bitter and childish like this trash heap portrays him as. He's not the autobots \"big brother\".. he's the LEADER WHO HAS LEAD FOR A LONG TIME. He wouldn't have needed to be persuaded by monkey Prime (Beast Wars the show was really good.. and they weren't that bad in this movie, except the fact that their bot forms are literally only shown at the very end.. and even still unrecognizable since the CGI was trash and it never actually showed them.. not to mention it's basically Optimis Primal, Airazor.. and cheetah bot and a rhino who don't do anything.. yup long parenthesis but oh well, because this trash was trash and you fools need to recognize.. not to mention it's BEAST WARS.. Dinosaur Megatron would have been awesome.. Scorponok was relegated to multiple shitty henchmen and . . oh, no other predacons.. let's randomly throw in Terrorcons.. Scourge was alright.. literally don't even know the others names..Although yellow truck bot actually looked cool) How about instead of Marky Mark (which was still leagues above these actors simply because of his BACKSTORY and the fact that he actually comes across as not just ACTING in some high school play like Fishbeck or whatever that girls name is with her literal one expression.. artifact crumbles into an alien relic üòê.. robots from space and a guy you don't know at all say risk your life and lead us to a place you literally just told us where it already is \"Okay\" üòê.. Oh no, eaglebot almost killed me literally no scream or anything she's just scooped up: üòê.. Spanish dudes freaking out .. fish back: üòê..) or some random Spanish dude that has ZERO backstory (who's acting wasn't bad, but they gave this dude literally nothing to work with.. hell the little brothers lines and his whole aura was actually one of the only highlights of this whole trashshow) just so we all know \"white people are evil and we HAVE to have a different race as the main characters.. this already so long I don't care. JUST MAKE TRANSFORMERS.. the way it was supposed to be made.. one blockbuster movie of awesome ass robots battling it out and let us invest in the BOTS.. what's so difficult about that.

Like I said, it wasn't perfect, but it was big, funny, sexy and a fun ride. This one feels like it was made in 1995 except for the woke script. The graphics look more like a cartoon and the Autobots dialogue was straight out of the campy TV show sans the respect for Prime. None of the sequels seemed to ackowledge much about the mythology from the previous movie - but this one tries to tie to the original show's plot while creating a completely ridiculous new mythology. The fact the Michael Bay even has his name on this one shocks me. Complete garbage."

I felt like I wasn't given enough backstory for the human characters and therefore didn't really care about them. I also felt like we werent given enough explanation to the plot and therefore it was hard to care about what the transformers were trying to do. We also have a whole new cast of transformers that we also aren't introduced to very well. I also feel like optimus prime has changed character completely. In the bay movies he is a very strong and confident leader. However in this film it feels like he has lost his leadership and is quite boring. Another problem is that the cgi is different to the bay movies. While it is mostly still good. The transformers look a lot more cartoony. Overall I would say that if you are a fan of the original cartoon from the 80s you will probably enjoy this film. However If you are a big fan of the bay movies you probably won't enjoy this one as much."

It is a prequel set in the 90s but makes no attempt to fit in with the other movies. We start with the Maximals on another planet, why are they animals? The auto bots chose cars to hide on earth, did that planet have the same animals as earth? Although they are giant versions of animals so they still don't fit in. The villain comes to destroy their home planet and their leader dies trying to stall. He fights the villain as a gorilla, so you assume that they don't have the ability to transform because otherwise why would you do that? Later we learn they can transform into robots with weapons, maybe their leader was just an idiot. We then are introduced to the humans with minimal background of both other than the fact that they are street smart and face racism. The male is supposed to be good with electronics - this never becomes a valuable skill. The female is an intern at a museum whose director uses her as an expert who gets no credit. We never get any background as to how she has so much knowledge of antiquities other than the fact that her dad was smart from looking things up on his own despite no college education. The male encounters the auto bots and is used to help them retrieve a newly discovered inter dimensional key at the museum. However they are intercepted by the villain who proceeds to beat up all the auto bots and steals the key (turns out to only be half). Optimus, generally the most experienced, wisest, and level headed transformer immediately blames the humans even though they had no knowledge of the villains and the villains managed to defeat every autobot. They then need to find the second half of the key which the female found through similar symbols in Peru. The only explanation as to why the humans are coming is the male doesn't want to trust the planets safety in their hands, as if he provides any help in a fight against giant advanced robots, and the female must come to help them find the location in Peru? They don't have gps or ability to access the internet as a technically advanced race of robots??"

      "review": "By far the worst Transformers movie. The worst part is it totally destroyed any time line of the movies. 1994,,, really. Then when did the Shai LaBeouf, Mark Walberg, and Bumblebee movies take place. The 70's and 80's??? Or are they all fighting different parts of the war at the same time. Stupid mess up of the time line. No character build up. Who are these people. 20 minutes into the movie and these 2 humans are faced with giant robot aliens. They have no fear or suspicion. Learn their technology. Then go and fight with Unicron with no problems. Oh wait,,, one guy needed money so... No thank you. Waited, and watched good movies for years waiting for this crappie 2 hour cut grab at money for the franchise. I been a fan of Transformers since the 80's cartoon, the Beast Wars, no w the live action movies. You boys at the Transformers movie franchise camp failed your viewers on this one. This would have been a great 2 part series. Please dont ruin it by trying again."

The movie goes nowhere and there's zero investment in any of the characters. This reboot needs a whole new reboot or let's go back to the Bayverse with a new cast."

I absolutely love that they started from the 80's to the 90's and supposedly will go to the next decade or two every movie thereafter all the way to the present day. (Spoiler) The ending was an absolute surprise and twist with the introduction to the G.I. Joe franchise crossing over. I cannot wait for the next one."

The transformers action, the music, the VFX are just *theatre applause* plus in the 90‚Äôs? Sign me up for this trilogy. Also that ending‚Ä¶ mind = Oppenheimer atomic bomb scenes."

      "review": "The film was slow, the character development was generic, the plot was recycled, and the CGI budget was clearly lacking. This felt like the least familiar transformers movie so far, it's yet another step down from the shia labeouf days. The transformer voices came off animated and the lines were extremely uninspired. The two main characters felt empty and their performances were extremely dull."

Varios momentos que me hicieron decir \"Daaaah\" de lo inveros√≠miles que eran, un par de chistes malos (pero malos malos eh) y que sent√≠ que hicieron esta pel√≠cula solo para vendernos un par mas hacen que no le ponga una calificaci√≥n mas alta."
