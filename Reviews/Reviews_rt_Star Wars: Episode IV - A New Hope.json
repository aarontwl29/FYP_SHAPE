What more could you ask for?"

    "review": "From the moment the iconic opening crawl bursts onto the screen, accompanied by John Williams' majestic fanfare, you're instantly transported to a galaxy far, far away. A New Hope isn't just a movie; it's an experience, a mythic adventure that ignites the imagination and resonates across generations. George Lucas masterfully crafts a timeless tale of good versus evil, set against a backdrop of breathtaking planetary landscapes and thrilling space battles. We're introduced to Luke Skywalker, a seemingly ordinary farm boy yearning for something more, who is thrust into an extraordinary destiny. Mark Hamill imbues Luke with a relatable innocence and burgeoning heroism that makes his journey utterly captivating. Alongside him, we encounter the roguish charm of Han Solo, brilliantly portrayed by Harrison Ford, and the unwavering spirit of Princess Leia, brought to life with strength and wit by Carrie Fisher. Their dynamic, filled with playful banter and underlying affection, forms the heart of the film. And who could forget the delightful droid duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO, whose comedic bickering provides much-needed levity amidst the galactic conflict? The film's visual effects, groundbreaking for their time, still hold a certain charm. The dogfights between X-wings and TIE fighters are exhilarating, and the sheer scale of the Death Star is awe-inspiring. But beyond the spectacle, A New Hope succeeds because of its compelling story and well-developed characters. It taps into universal themes of hope, courage, and the power of belief. The Force, a mystical energy field that binds the galaxy together, adds a layer of wonder and spirituality to the narrative. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise Jedi Master played with gravitas by Alec Guinness, serves as a mentor figure, guiding Luke on his path and introducing us to this fascinating concept. A New Hope isn't a perfect film, perhaps a little rough around the edges in places, but its imperfections only add to its enduring appeal. It feels genuine, a passionate creation that sparked a cultural phenomenon. It's a film you can revisit time and time again and still feel the thrill of that first viewing. It's more than just a science fiction movie; it's a fairy tale in space, a testament to the power of storytelling, and a reminder that even in the darkest of times, a new hope can always emerge. It's a cinematic masterpiece that continues to inspire and entertain, and its legacy will undoubtedly endure for generations to come."

Huh. 6) Luke Skywalker is quite an annoying teenager in the first act. 7) It still looks pretty good. 8) Obi-Wan's death is just odd. 9) Luke's Uncle is a bit of a d*ick. 10) Luke's Aunt is barely given any dialogue worthy of noticing. 11) Rogue One is a touch better"

The key to success is that the audience can sympathize & understand the characters & the plot keeps the audience invested in the outcome. Millions of people were entranced by the Death Star, Lightsabres, The Force, Luke, Han, Leia, Obi-wan, Darth Vader, R2D2, & C3PO. This is the film that started it all - it's almost unbelievable.

The special effects in this film make it easy to see why it was so groundbreaking and technologically advanced for 1977, ILM does a brilliant job on capturing the feel of a sci-fi epic and they capture the Star Wars galaxy perfectly. The acting is also quite good for actors who were new to acting, Alec Guinness' performance as Obi-Wan is the only Star Wars performance to be nominated, though I can see why, he isn't the best actor in the series. This film is certainly the most agreeable in the series and is one that you have to see in the cinema to get a full Star Wars '77 experience. 9.7/10."

He is the best. Second place R2D2. R2D2 locked in.

I know my dad told me I loved it and I became obsessed with it as a kid (well I still am). Whenever it was released in the theaters in the '70s, '80s, and 97's special editions, I tried to see it when possible. Space, aliens, action, spaceships, and DRIODS. I remember R2D2 was and still is my favorite character from the first Star Wars. I even had an R2D2 cake my mom had made for me at 5 years. This movie, besides Empire, is my all-time favorite movie. It has non-stop action and the story, many may figure it to be predictable, but it's the way it is presented. But, to me it is Perfect. Ford, Hamill, and Fisher are the greatest trio. George Lucas' Star Wars revolutionized the world during this time and it still has stood the test of time. My favorite part of the movie (which is pretty the whole movie) is hard to pick but the final battle on the death star does it for me. I have seen this movie so many times, I can pretty much quote it line for line, and even more geeky I can follow the soundtrack to the movie without watching out. Now many fans out there prefer the original cut of this movie but I prefer and love all the changes that George made. This doesn't mean I do love the original cut, but it just makes and enhances this movie's experience. It did not change the plot or characters but pretty much improved the action and SFX."

It's a simple, timeless story that embraces familiar archetypes such as the restless farm boy who longs for adventure, the salty pirate smuggler who's only out for his own greed, the wizened sorcerer with a mysterious past, the determined princess of a kingdom in distress; the dark knight that serves a shadowy and tyrannical overlord. Though it may sound clich√©, this space saga subverted all expectations in the best way when it was released. Star Wars became a standard throughout industry-wide film making innovation that resulted in a boom of new effects in both sound and visual aspects of film production. That in itself deserves more, but 5 stars is the limit, so I'm giving this flick the highest rating I can. I still think of Star Wars: A New Hope as the very beginning of a whole new kind of movie. Lucas (with his Light & Magic) had a vision that lit up the whole art of film!!"

    "review": "Released in 1977, George Lucas' Star Wars was an instant megahit earning itself a lot more than its $11M budget, to say the least, spawning one of the biggest movie franchises of all time which is still going strong to this day, albeit under new management. In the vein of the old Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon serials, Star Wars is a space adventure following young farmer Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) epic journey as he joins the Rebels to take down the evil Empire and their new world-ending weapon: the Death Star. With the help of the mysterious Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), tough guy smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford), his pal Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Princess Leia of the planet Alderaan (Carrie Fisher) and two faithful droids, they set out to use the Death Star plans to destroy it once and for all. Lucas' film begins in somewhat humble fashion as we spend a good amount of time with droids C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) on a desert planet before encountering Luke Skywalker who soon becomes informed of the princess' capture by the villainous Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earle Jones). Star Wars proceeds to deliver a jaw-dropping spectacle with elements of classic westerns, swashbucklers and samurai films thrown in. The result is a type of cheesy sci-fi space opera that many had tried to create prior for the big screen, without much success, as Star Wars also worked brilliantly as a mainstream modern action blockbuster. This loving homage to the science-fiction serials of the 1930's is packed with charm thanks to the likable cast (Harrison Ford steals the show as Han Solo) and the sheer imagination flagrant on the screen. The sets are hugely impressive, the special effects are groundbreaking and make this wild tale look as convincing as possible. The whole thing is complemented by John Williams' unforgettable score that sets the tone perfectly. There are some pacing issues; the desert and pre-war scenes are a bit of a snooze; but the film will win you over by the end. The impact of Star Wars on cinema and culture in general has, obviously, been huge and it all began with a film that aims high without any pretension, only aiming to be the most entertaining and creative movie that it could be. The Special Edition hurts this one quite a bit so, if you somehow can find the original version, that's your best bet. Iconic."

    "review": "Star Wars: A New Hope (1977) is an action-packed film written and directed by George Lucas. The story is set a long time ago in a galaxy far far away where the galaxy is ruled by the tyrannical Galactic Empire. The story revolves around the Rebel Alliance stealing the architectural plans of the Empire's new deadly space station otherwise known as the \"Death Star\" under the command of the sinister imperial leader Darth Vader. When the Rebel leader, Princess Leia is captured by the Empire, Luke Skywalker acquires the stolen architectural plans and sets out to rescue her whilst learning the metaphysical power known as \"The Force\" from Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. I was extremely impressed by the film as a whole. The graphic and soundtrack remains a classic among the filming industry, despite being released almost 50 years ago. The film adds a slight touch of comical scenes and phrases that made the whole film itself more lively. It is truly a timeless masterpiece that doesn't seem to age. This film always deserves a place in my heart as one of the best films ever made. I highly recommend this to everybody that enjoys science-fiction and action."

    "review": "George Lucas' attempt to take on a world of this magnitude clearly does not pan out the way that he wants it to, which is shown throughout this movie, because Star Wars: A New Hope acts as a would-be franchise starter, but the \"good\" of the movie that you might be able to find (maybe with a magnifying glass) is let down by inconsistencies, lazy storytelling, and a plot riddled with holes that make for gigantic gaps in the story that barrel it down, George Lucas made an attempt to make a sci-fi world to capture the audience's attention- but his attempt was feeble and does not play out. In conclusion, George Lucas, shut up, take a seat at the kid writer's table, and go let the people who can actually think up of a world this big and keep it fresh- along with keeping the details in their heads so one section is different from the other. George Lucas, in full conclusion, shut the hell up, go away, and let the people GOOD at writing do this so we don't have to make room for your crap."

The characters have no emotions, Luke has hi reaction to his aunt and uncle dying and we never see Leia grieve that her entire home planet and everything she knew has been blown to pieces. The special effects are ground breaking for its time and so e of them still hold up. Over all the movie is really beautiful, the compositions especially. The designs and world building is of course stellar and genius. Bit as a movie overall, the story is simplistic to say the least and the characters are flat."

The depiction of an ‚Äòused future' (developed again shortly thereafter by Ridley Scott's \"Alien\"), the outstanding artisan model and visual techniques, the original world in which the story has been immersed with its distinctive costumes and its balance between fable and comic book, are the main ingredients of a pop culture phenomenon that has origin in no less than genius intuitions. The movie's major concept tied to a stark contrast of ‚Äògood against evil' and the quite predictable consequences of most of the characters' choices and plot turns may be simplistic, but also look universal, while the story is dotted with narrative shortcuts that over time have been forgiven on account of the status achieved by the movie. This first episode is also the least academic of the saga and has a depth and a sense of adventure that the following instalments haven't maintained. The Luke's character is at his most lively (that's before the acquired Jedi-awareness), Han Solo is at his most cynical and impertinent (the romance with Leia goes full throttle not before the second release), Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi assures a powerful presence and Darth Vader is employed in a more subtle, less extensive and by that more threatening way, avoiding that mannered, so much bigger than life, representation of him displayed in the next episodes. The film editing also results more engaging in this first movie, specially the aerial battles enjoy more of that rock'n'roll pace that will influence later releases such as \"Top Gun\", while in the subsequent episodes of the saga the battles look much more polished."

Yes, some aspects of this movie don't hold up to todays standards but it does a fairly good job overall. George Lucas was able to crest a world that was able to capture the fascination of many generations. The world-building is great and you just want to keep learning more about this world. The Jedi and lightsabers are so intriguing. I couldn't imagine the excitement of seeing this movie for the first in 1977. There are just so many iconic moments littered throughout this movie. It's actually incredible to see the stories they were able to make from this movie. One of the best stories ever told and probably the most influential movie of all time."

    "review": "Excelente pel√≠cula, no solo es buena por como es como pel√≠cula, sino por todo lo que hizo por el mundo del cine. Teniendo en cuenta que en la d√©cada de los 70 nadie apostaba por la ciencia ficci√≥n o nadie lo tocaba porque era una ruina, aparece George Lucas y tras arriesgarse le dio como resultado una obra maestra. Ya hablando de la pel√≠cula, esta sienta las bases de un universo demasiado grande y cont√°ndonos una historia que en un futuro iba a ser extendida contando muchas cosas que ocurrieron antes de esta. Nos presenta a los personajes que se volver√≠an las principales caras de la saga como por ejemplo Luke, Leia, Han solo, R2-D2, C3-PO, Chewbacca, Ben Kenobi, etc., y por el lado de los villanos nos presenta al que para mi es el mejor villano de todo el cine, Darth Vader, quien desde el primer momento en pantalla genera miedo y te das cuenta del gran peso del personaje en la cinta. Algo que no recordaba mucho es el poder que tiene Tarkin, siendo hasta superior a Vader y teni√©ndolo a el como su ayudante/secuaz. Las actuaciones creo que est√°n muy bien, todos encajan perfectamente en los papeles y tiene actores de renombre como Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness, David Prowse, etc. Algo que destacar es la banda sonora de John Williams, quien hizo una de las mejores bandas sonoras de la historia del cine con una gran cantidad de temas excelentes. En cuanto a los efectos pr√°cticos, creo que para la √©poca estaban bastante bien logrados, sin embargo algo que no me gusto fueron las cosas agregadas por CGI en las ediciones que se hicieron d√©cadas despu√©s del estreno, siento que no quedan para nada en la cinta. El ritmo de la pel√≠cula es algo que puede llegar a cansar a algunas personas, ya que es una de las pel√≠culas de Star Wars mas lentas, con muy poca acci√≥n y con bastante dialogo y un ritmo lento. La poca acci√≥n presente en la pel√≠cula me gusto, siento que esta bastante bien para la √©poca y mucho mas no se pod√≠a hacer, ya que por ejemplo el duelo entre Obi Wan y Darth Vader es bastante lento y tosco comparado a otros duelos de la saga pero creo que no esta nada mal. Hay que decir que la pel√≠cula tiene errores y algunas conveniencias pero a mi parecer no son errores tan negativos como para bajar su puntuaci√≥n final. En conclusi√≥n, una de las pel√≠culas que cambiaron el mundo del cine por todo lo que significo y una cinta con una historia, personajes, banda sonora, efectos, etc. brillantes en su mayor√≠a, siendo el inicio de una de mis sagas favoritas y la que sent√≥ las bases para todo lo que se venia para esta maravillosa y enorme franquicia. Muy recomendada."

    "review": "Without a doubt this is one of the greatest Star Wars movies ever made mostly because it gives birth to Star Wars and starts off the Star Wars story. So I watched all the SW movies in 2022 and for the movie being made over 30 years ago I was amazed by everything. Action, although this movie is from over 30 years ago it was amazing I really love it obviously it wasn't perfect but lets remember it was made over 30 years ago and they tried really hard to make it awesome and they did. Acting, the acting is perfect without question the acting is perfect Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness, they all made an perfect job. CGI, although the movie was made in the 70s CGI was barely a thing because there was no CGI back in the 60s but SW nailed it with the CGI and I don't know how they made it so perfect for the 70s. Villain, without a doubt Vader is one of the greatest villain of all time a lot of villains across all franchises are great but Vader is in top 3 in my opinion. Writing is perfect the writers did a very perfect job and they should be very proud of their work for this movie. Story is perfect because like I said before this movie is perfect because it starts off the Star Wars story. Casting is beyond perfect no explanation needed I can not imagine anyone else playing Luke Skywalker other than Mark Hamill. Characters are 10/10 all of them. Adventure is perfect because it just is you watch the movie you know what I'm talking about. Mystery I think that the mystery is great because I started watching the original trilogy with no idea about what I was gonna watch but it was mysterious and it always let me wonder what happened next. Ending, the ending was amazing I love the final fight so amazing how they did it definitely has to be one of the great SW endings of all time. However one thing I didn't like is the Obi-Wan died I watch SW in order and I grew to love Obi-Wan and all the other Jedi but Obi-Wan is my most favorite character in SW history and it really pained me to see him die."

    "review": "Star Wars A New Hope is a truly amazing film. From the opening scene that draws you in with the amazing soundtrack and great special effects. Right after the credits roll we are immediately introduced to a few of the main characters Darth Vader (Aniken Skywalker), Princes leia, Luke Skywalker, and R2D2. Although one could say this is only a good versus evil story Star Wars is set apart with the element of sci-fi set in space, even when compared to modern day movies this movie's graphics and editing can hold its own. Even watching this movie 40+ years later the only thing that you can tell is different is the camera quality‚Ä¶ and hair styles. This movie produced some of the most memorable scenes in movie history but the one I think that is the most memorable is one of the first scenes of Darth Vader coming onto the rebel ship to kidnap the princes and to get the location of the main rebel base. Now we cannot go any further in this piece without talking about this truly historic soundtrack. There are not many words that can really comprehend how amazing, uplifting, and as tense as this is. Almost all of the soundtrack used in the original Star Wars is being conducted in orchestras around the world. The next great thing about this movie is the setting, from desert climates to lush green forests it truly looked like all of the scenes were shot on different planets. Yet another thing I want to highlight is the fact that this sci fi film does not just have humins in it, it has many different species of aliens with their own unique languages. Another great thing about the effects are the spaceships that everyone is zooming around in. For a 70s era movie what do you expect to see when you think of a spaceship well you are probably thinking something of low quality and not good looking, well that is simply not true the spaceships are very vivid and look very possibly real from a theater perspective. My point being like earlier this is further evidence that you should not shy away from the movie just because it is from the 1970s. -Ben Kerstein"

    "review": "Jeff Barnes 1/12/23 Star Wars a New Hope Review Star Wars a New Hope is about a teenager named Luke Skywalker who goes on a journey to save the galaxy from the shattering space station know as the death star. Luke also goes on a journey to rescue a princess name Leia from the evil Darth Vader. Star Wars a New Hope changed the way films were made forever. It revived the genre of science fiction. Star Trek had defined it or turn it into a phenomenon. The film also has philosophy, religion, inquisitiveness, and colorful characters who are relatable. Star Wars a New Hope made films and science fiction more fascinating with its special effects such as with hovering vehicles, plenty of wars involving lasers hence the title of the film being Star Wars and having many iconic elements such as a weapon known as the lightsaber. Star Wars a New Hope makes us think. It teaches us that we can achieve anything or help ourselves if we have enough faith or as the wizard, Obi Wan Kenobi, teaches the Force. The Force is a special power or privilege that only certain people known as Jedi possess. Star Wars a New Hope has colorful characters that are relatable, particularly Luke Skywalker. In the film Luke wants to go away to the academy which means a lot to him. It's like going away to college and being independent. Obi Wan Kenobi is relatable because he reminds us of having more wisdom as we get older. Star Wars a New Hope is a must see with its many wonderful elements such as: intriguing characters, special effects, philosophy, and many more."

Any film that you adore as both a child and adult and remains an amazing feat of film really shows its legacy! A masterpiece of film and one that was influenced by several different films including Akira Kurosawa's \"The Hidden Fortress\" (1958) and \"Yojimbo\" (1961), John Ford's \"The Searchers\" (1956) and the original Flash Gordon serials.

I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection. I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive. And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character. All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Fighter jets in space, flying through a massive trench lined with massive guns to fire a missile into a small exhaust port and destroy a moon-sized space station capable of destroying an entire planet. Nothing of that scale had ever been seen before 1977. It may not have the best duels in Star Wars, or the best story in Star Wars, but hands down, the Death Star Trench Run has to be the greatest space battle of all time. On the other hand, Obi-Wan's sacrifice didn't seem as meaningful until 1999 when we saw Obi-Wan again in the prequel trilogy. And this movie is only made better by Rogue One (2016)."

Not a whole lot of retconning going on actually, in the newer movies, in reflection upon re-watching this one. Following a much darker period in the prequels, this does seem a little on the light side, though there are moments of comedy in the prequel elements. It does actually hold up remarkably well, even all the visual effects. I watched the somewhat post-prequel updated or specialized version, rather than the original or de specialized edition, and aside from a couple of slightly shoddy new effects, and old ones, it's remarkably good. I do wish that the prequel's had been a little lighter, especially in the recent Obi Wan series, with Obi Wan's character, given he's not a particularly serious individual in this movie - rather relaxed in my estimation. The only real misgiving I have about this movie comes from a particular light saber battle, which I do wonder if the prequels lent themselves towards undermining, inadvertently, given they're better equipped to pull those related visuals off. Anyway, this is fun, well written, well acted, looks great (despite being quite an old sci-fi movie), and in my estimation would potentially even hold up with consideration to younger audiences that may inevitably drift into this in the wake of the prequels, other series pieces, and more recent franchise sequels."

Master Yoda trains Luke to become a Jedi Knight while his friends try to fend off the Imperial fleet. Return of the Jedi: (main hero) Luke Skywalker attempts to bring (main villain) Darth Vader back to the light side of the Force. At the same time, the rebels hatch a plan to destroy the second Death Star. -The directors George Lucas, Irvin Kershiner and Richard McQuarmand did an amazing job. George also directs \"American Graffiti\" and \"THX-1138\". Irvin also directs \"Robocop 2\". They're awesome The actors Mark Hamill (plays as Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (as Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (as Princess Leia) and James Earl Jones (voiced as Darth Vader) are so awesome in the trilogy. They did fantastic It's a Live-Action one It's Action packed, Science-Fiction and Fantasy Movie My favourite Scene is the Space Battle bits and Lightsaber fights I've watched it on DVD, cinemas and Disney+ I saw it with my family I love this trilogy because these are really awesome, I started to watch this trilogy when I was 10 years old after it came out on DVD. My favourite characters are Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 I love the Lightsaber fight scenes I love the Space Battle scenes because it's Heart-Pounding I love the Characters because they're awesome The costumes are so cool The composer John Williams is really great The sound effects are really cool The special effects are really awesome A New Hope: 10/10 The Empire Strikes Back: 10/10 Return of the Jedi: 10/10 Total: 10/10"

This is a great movie, I remember watching this a lot as a kid and being absolutely in love with how creative and fun the world of Star Wars is. George Lucas is a creative genius, every aspect of this film is well done. Han Solo is one of my favourite Star Wars characters, Harrison Ford does an amazing job of playing a jerk. That's what Han Solo starts as a jerk, but you love him none the less because of how funny and Bada** he is. Mark Hamill is really good as Luke Skywalker, one scene I always think of when I think of Luke is the scene where he is gazing at the two suns of Tatooine. The mix of cinematography and John Williams score is incredible. John Williams score is one of the most iconic ever made. To this day if you play one of his songs it will be identified as a Star Wars theme. Finally Darth Vader. Darth Vader is one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. Right from the beginning when he walks into that hallway you know how much of a menace this guy is. This film is phenomenal and I love it every time I see it. With loads of fun characters and a immersive world Star Wars is a blast. 10/10"

    "review": "Star Wars: Episode 4 ‚Äì A New Hope is an amazing coming of age story, with a wonderful David and Goliath theme/good and evil vibe. The movie opens with this hot girl Leia, played by Carrie Fisher cruising with her friends to the movies. When her ride stalls out, this very alpha male frat boy, Darth Vader, voiced by James Earl Jones, picks her and her friends up in his muscle car. Meanwhile we are introduced to Luke Skywalker played by Mark Hamill. He's stuck living on a rural farm with his aunt and uncle. He goes to the city for concerts, and to shop for records as often as he can, and dreams of being the lead singer of his own garage band, but his chores around the farm occupy most of his time. A chance encounter with a bassist C3PO, played by Anthony Daniels, and a drummer R2D2, who break down on the road near Luke's family farm becomes the nucleus of his band which will soon be known as Luke Skywalker and the Rebel Alliance. The trio now have everything they need for their garage band except a kick-ass guitarist. Leia starts dating Darth, and becomes his heavy metal band's number one groupie. Darth's group, The First Galactic Empire, already have a record deal, and are competing in the Mos Eisley Battle of the Bands (named Star Wars, A New Hope) that happens every year at the end of harvest season. Darth and the First Galactic Empire have all the best sound guys, amps, instruments, and sound boards. They are the marquee act of Palpatine Records, and the label is determined make sure Darth and his band crush all comers at the upcoming battle of the bands. Luke, and his fledgling band the Rebel Alliance meet a washed-up record producer, Ben Kenobi, played by Alec Guinness, who has a small home studio. He sees the promise of Luke's plucky garage trio, and soon hooks them up with the kick-ass guitarist they've been looking for, Han Solo, played by fresh face Harrison Ford. Han has a sweet '76 Chevy van with bubble tinted teardrop porthole windows and Cragar five spoke rims, which he lovingly calls the Millennium Falcon. Han's best friend, local weed dealer Chew Bacca, played by Peter Mahew, comes on as sound guy/roadie/driver. Ben gets the band into the battle of the bands, while refining their sound. Tragedy strikes Luke's family, and Darth's jealously over C3PO and R2D2 joining the Rebel Alliance over the First Galactic Empire exasperate matters. Leia gets fed up with Darth's intense dark vibe, and the grindy blues feel of The First Galactic Empire's music. She starts dating Luke, but there isn't really any chemistry, but Leia and Han immediately realize they have something special. Also, Luke Skywalker and the Rebel Alliance have become a pretty tight four piece by this point, smashing out some pretty raw surf inspired garage tunes. Unfortunately, if they are going to win Star Wars, A New Hope, they will have to do it without Ben, who dies tragically before he can see his prot√©g√© fulfill his rock star destiny. The stage is set for a battle of the bands, and it's clear Luke and Darth's bands will be the finalists. The First Galactic Empire play their three-song set first, and finish with their dark grinding heavy metal anthem \"Death Star.\" Luke and the Rebel Alliance crescendo up during their three-song set to their inspirational protest ballad \"Suck My Proton Torpedo,\" and literally blow Darth and \"Death Star\" away. The judges award the prize money to Luke and the Rebel Alliance, and the crowd response to the Rebel Alliance dwarfs response for Darth's band. The name of the contest, \"A New Hope,\" takes on a prophetic meaning as Luke and the Rebel Alliance appear poised to conquer the music world. Near the end, we see Darth recover his composure, hinting at a possible sequel. Perhaps Darth will try to reform the First Galactic Empire, or strike out on a bitter campaign of revenge. Maybe he will attempt to utilize Luke's musical talents for his own purposes. We'll have wait and see what relative Hollywood newcomer, and Star Wars creator, George Lucas, has in mind for the future of the franchise."

    "review": "I have always been someone who when choosing a Star Wars movie will always go with something from the prequels. While I know they aren't the best of films I love the characters and from my memory the original trilogy just wasn't that great to me. I've been putting it off for years but now I am finally going to rewatch the original trilogy as the last viewing I had was roughly seven years ago. After watching the new Book of Boba Fett I was inspired to watch this trilogy and its first entry impressed me on a lot of levels. The first being the visuals; while they are dated, especially the laser blasts the film looks futuristic and the different species, envirmentents, lore, and architecture does not take the time to be explained or welcomed into the audience's knowledge. Instead the direction they take is more invasive and in your face. Events and terms of the Star Wars universe are dropped into casual conversation without any explanation making you feel like you're viewing the story rather than being told the story. Right off the bat it succeeds at something the prequels largely fails at in making exposition flow more naturally. It allows its audience to assume the obvious without having to explain it and it makes you feel like it doesn't have time to waste. Its pacing is another successful element. We spend just enough time with each main character and put them in the correct circumstances to form some kind of bond that will later grow into a great friendship. We go from location to location meeting new characters just as we come to understand and explore the last. Allowing us to be acquainted with their traits, desires, and motivations. Its presentation of information is perfect for the consumption of even the most general of audiences. The story is a crowd pleasing tale that takes each main character's arc and pays it off in the third act in a pleasing way. Obi Wan inspired Luke and educated him on his legacy to send him along on his destiny fulfilling his purpose. R2 finds Obi Wan and delivers the plans back to Leia while helping her escape her captivity. Leia's plan succeeds and she is able to get the plans back to the rebellion to plan an attack on the death star. Luke wishes to leave his farm life and become a pilot but when he loses his Aunt and Uncle he chooses to follow his destiny and learn the force to become a great warrior like his father causing him to wish to help the rebellion. Han wants money and behaves in a greedy way but in the end proves he has humanity in him and because of Leia's plan and Hans' help Luke is able to destroy the death star with the help of R2. Because all the arcs and motivations go hand and hand the story pays off in the most satisfying way possible. The final thing the film succeeds at is the stakes and danger in the third act. We don't want to see the empire win and we see so many characters die we don't know who could be next. Although it's obvious Luke is going to destroy the death star and not die, we don't want the other pilots to die. Unfortunately they all do and I give the movie credit for that because this is a war and the empire is clearly better equipped. Because of how invested I was in the character of Biggs who is mentioned at the beginning of the film I was sad to see him die and so distracted that when Han showed up and saved the day I didn't expect it somehow. Because of this the emotional payoff worked much better than maybe it should have. But the film has some flaws I would like to address that holds it back from the full five stars. Number one the amount of characters that die that are close to the main characters is crazy and that's fine but the way it's handled is what I find poor. Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru are essentially Luke's Mom and Dad and Luke sees their burning bodies and displays distress but realistically he should have been devastated screaming and crying or angry. He is mostly sheltered living on Tatooine in a small farm and clearly isn't exposed to much violence as he is later shown to be disturbed by Obi Wan cutting off an alien's arm in a bar. He is portrayed as naive. So why then does he kinda shrug it off and instead focus on becoming like his dad. It just doesn't feel natural. Even less natural is when Leia's entire planet is destroyed, her home, her family, her friends. Everything and everyone she has ever known and she kinda just whines and begs them not to. No devastation or emotional reaction. The next time we see her she is doing a playboy pose in her cell. The lack of humanity is disturbing. Even later when we watch Biggs get blown away Luke kind of makes a stone face. It makes sense that he would return his focus to the task at hand but it would have been more emotionally satisfying to have him say some words of sentiment and have some kind of funeral for all the fallen soldiers or something. But the happy ending with the ceremony and celebration leaves us with a note of triumph and it is pleasing but it doesn't really emphasize the cost of fighting this war. Overall the film had memorable characters, a complete and compelling story filled with danger and emotion and an impressive spectacle of visuals and word building. It is an obvious classic completely expertly crafted from its story to its beautiful and iconic soundtrack."

    "review": "This is one of the films that has become sewn into the very fabric of our popular culture. Yet, every day new kids are born who have never seen it. Watched through the lens of a young child, some of the scarier moments suddenly become more striking. Darth Vader is one of the great film villains for a reason, he's a frightening figure who engages in some very real moments of violence. With the continued prominence of the Saar Wars story through animated series, video games, and toys, it may be tempting to introduce films to children when they are too young to handle these more intense moments. But if kids are old enough to handle them, then it's likely that A New Hope will blow their minds. It remains an enduring classic for the same reasons it made such an explosive impression back in 1977. It's full of pulse pounding action lifted straight from the classic 1930s film serials, it's got humor and character, and the story guides you effortlessly into a completely original universe full of strange creatures and amazing sights. It's easy to be cynical about Star Wars given the billions of dollars it's earned selling everything from DVDs to toothbrushes but returning to the original film with fresh eyes will remind you just how remarkable it was, and continues to be."

    "review": "A fantastic sci-fi, fantasy movie Star Wars is certainly one of the easiest movies in the genre to digest. This may be due to its simple and straightforward plot, easily defined lines between good and evil, with characters that you want to root for. A total cotton candy movie but that's still one very enjoyable carnival treat. The only ding I have to give is the dated look of some of the sequences especially the final action scene. A lot has been said about this movie so I'll leave it at this: watch this movie if for no other reason than to see what all the fuss is about. You'll at least appreciate the Star Wars culture and you may become a fan yourself."

    "review": "A unique and influential film that still continues to affect the world today, \"A New Hope\" remains one of the strongest \"Star Wars\" films to this day, providing insanely iconic scenes, lines, and characters that many people who haven't even seen the movie can recognize. The acting is done very well, and the worldbuilding is one of the best. This film also perfectly sets up the rest of the saga, introducing new characters and places while still leaving room for tons more to be added. The story and plot does begin to slow down after the second act finished, though it quickly picks up again during the attack on the Death Star. Overall, just a great film that continues to remain a timeless classic."

The characters, the different worlds and species all woven together for a timeless movie that we as an audience had never seen before. Growing up watching this over and over again as a child and play acting the characters are cherished memories. John William's scores still bring goosebumps. And the scene with Luke watching the binary sunsets with that one score always gets me."

    "review": "George Lucas isn't quite the most creative person in the history of Hollywood, but he was creative in the exact right way at the exact right time, inventing not only a unique fusion of genres (that proved way more successful than even he could have imagined) but a new type of special effects approach (moving the camera around an object, rather than the opposite like everyone else). The original Star Wars represents the pinnacle of a simple story with a hidden depth when examined closer. The world is well realized, the villains incredibly intimidating and memorable, what is and is-not possible is well established quickly, and it largely plays out as a feel-good movie with a few moments of genuine tension or drama. Mix in good performances, likable characters, awesome action sequences and some of the best audio (both music and sound effects) of any movie, and you've got a movie that has, and will forever, stand the test of time."

    "review": "What made Hollywood and gave the foundation to the sci-fingenre. Star Wars. A simple story about galatic governments, smugglers, space wizards, space ships and robots. This idea of film sounded absolutely insane in 1977. But for George Lucas it was a story, his story. That he believe was worth telling. All these years later, it sure did pay off. Not only is the film simple to follow, but the characters are likeable, then set pieces and score are fantastic. It's all great and is a solid film. I highly recommend any film goer to gives this a shot, and see what the hype is all about."

    "review": "[‚≠êÔ∏è96%] Instantly viewers fell in love with the Star Wars universe thanks to A New Hope's (1977) fantastic immediate world building, all done in a natural way thanks to a great plot which takes the characters to necessary places for events to play out. All of the development for the Galaxy, force and many other aspects is done in a very efficient way which allows the viewer to be excited for an expanding galaxy and hence why the franchise still runs over 40 years after this film. Given the year it was made, 1997, this movie has some very impressive special effects, better than some you see nowadays in 2021. Despite limited screen time, Darth Vader immediately established himself as a legendary villain thanks to his menacing presence and his ability to steal every scene he is in. You couldn't ask for a better introduction to one of the most influential franchises of all time."

    "review": "Yeah, this is just classic Star Wars in every sense of the word. In one sense, it's surprising that this is the first Star Wars Project as it feels like we are really starting right in the middle of things. They are already name-dropping the Clone Wars and the Senate when it will be literal decades before we really know what was truly going. So in one sense, it's kind of a risk to start right in the middle of things without loads of backstop, but it 100% works. It's probably the easiest movie to jump into as well which is probably why it worked. The introduction to our classic heroes is just really done, as well as seeing Obi-Wan and Darth Vader in light of their larger story. And finally, this is a movie that I feel has only gotten better thanks to everything else that we have gotten since. Especially after watching both seasons of Andor and Rogue One, everything in this movie feels like it has so much weight and you understand the stakes more in light of all the hardships, trials, and sacrifices that led to this moment and how significant this moment now is."

    "review": "A legendary ambitious start to the ever-expanding star wars saga, George Lucas opened our eyes to new possibilities of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same since audiences have seen that opening crawl for the first time. Starting in the middle of the story(Episode IV) It is a thrilling adventure of young farmboy Luke Skywalker who with the help of old Jedi master obi-wan Kenobi follows his hero's journey and begins learning the ways of the force and become a Jedi himself as he and hotshot smuggler Han solo along with wookie Chewbacca(captain and co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon), work together with the companionable droid duo of R2-D2 and C-3PO to rescue princess leia, and help the Rebel Alliance in their fight to restore freedom and justice to the Galaxy as they go up against menacing Darth Vader and his waves of imperial storm troopers. The story is a perfect morality tale as good goes up against evil and it feeds people's hunger for adventure, thrills ,and comedy. This 1977 film is a classic and with the story, John William's brilliant musical scores and the huge leaps that it takes with special effects and other filmmaking techniques(which were many building blocks towards even better techniques for modern filmmaking) this film will live on in people's hearts and minds for generations but don't take my word for it, go out there and see it for yourself!!! no longer will you have to fear about not knowing what the force is or what a wookie is or even how many languages C-3P0 can speak, this film is the perfect first steps into a larger world! May the force be with you,Always!"
