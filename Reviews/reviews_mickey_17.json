Mickey 17 is more sympathetic than Mickey 7, and the films depictions of female characters are again, way more fleshed out and interesting. It's chaotic and hilarious. Give it a go."

His main character (Mickey 17) wasn't the ballsy type that we were expecting in the beginning (knowing that he chose the bravest job on the ship). He played a timid and gentle soul - which we're not use to seeing. His acting was believable. The humor wasn't there. If anything, you're laughing because most of the scenes and characters were bad. I couldn't finish the last 49 mins of the movie. I wish they chose a different cast for this movie. I think it would have elevated it a lot more."

It poses the existential questions about life, death and does it all have meaning if you can be \"reconstructed\" and have your most recent memories restored. Pattinson is great, but Mark Ruffalo provides most of the comic relief as a wannabe dictator. Go watch it. Cheers."

While 'MICKEY 17' wasn't a bad watch, it still had it's bumps, although, this movie was steady and quite engaging to an extent, it was not enough to make it an amazing cinematic experience. The movie started out well, but felt too dragged to be enjoyed. This movie, however, was pulled out of it's icy rubbles by Robert Pattinson's power-house dual performance proving once more that you cannot get enough of Pattinson. Naomi Ackie also made up for the length by giving us one of her best performance yet. The ensemble was great. Bong Joon Ho also directed this movie to a solid ground but it just wasn't enough to keep this movie on air. Bong Joon Ho's 'MICKEY 17' was a decent watch, but it didn't quite feel like the Bong Joon Ho movie we are used to which at the end caused this movie to give a mid cinematic experience!"

I couldn't actually tell you how long it was because it was getting so tiresome I switched it off sometime in the 3rd act. It's a shame because the premise was interesting; the lead role was played perfectly. This isn't a case of left vs right, if there's a politician to be made fun of, I'm all for it. However this was executed with such low effort and writing craft I couldn't reward it with any more of my time. If I wanted a mediocre rehash of why all the cool kids hate Trump I'd just go to the in laws for dinner, at least they'd wash the dishes. I mean seriously, this movie goes to enormous lengths to make the Trump character *so* much like the real Donald. However they shy away from a 1:1 impression so you're left with this uncanny valley Trump, its really quite unnerving to watch. They should have just deepfaked it and maybe then it would be funny or even memorable. Probably not"

      "review": "Mickey 17 is a visually glorious and surprisingly romantic film that caught me totally off guard. It nails the sci-fi aesthetics and the look of the movie really helped sell the premise for me. Its not revolutionary or wildly innovative but the story is interesting and grounded in deeply human themes. Robert Pattinson gives an amazing performance (once you get past the slightly goofy character voice) and effortlessly carries the emotional and existential weight of the film with impressive charm. The first act is by far the strongest: compelling, mysterious, and tightly paced. It sets up a fascinating world and a main character that had me fully engaged. But it does seem to fumble around as the movie goes on... especially in the final act. While I really like Mark Ruffalo and I think he brings his all to this role, his character (along with a few others) lacks subtlety and depth in a way that I felt cheapened the story. Nevertheless, the journey is engaging and rewarding... especially any time Naomi Ackle and Anamaria Vartolomei are onscreen. Overall, it's a fun and engaging watch with a surprisingly romantic core. I'd easily recommend."

      "review": "I had fun watching this film. It was a little bit weird, but creative and different enough to be enjoyable. In an era where originality is lacking in entertainment, this was a welcomed breath of fresh air. It touches on a few important ethical subjects, while also managing to be funny, in a dark humour type way. It's not without it's flaws tho. I think the first half of the movie is better than the last. It was more interesting and intriguing. It's not a major flaw tho. The movie still remains solid in the latter half. It's just that it seems like 2 movies were glued together. Bong Joon-Ho's \"Parasite\" also had that aspect of 2 different stories merging near the end, but it worked great there. Here it wasn't as effective. The other flaw, and the biggest one, was Mark Ruffalo's acting. He seemed to be doing a Trump impression (a pretty bad one, since he is such a bad actor), mixed with some other personality, which made the scenes he was in extremely annoying. Everytime he showed up, it made me want to press the forward button. That's how annoying it was. I heard people complain about this movie and saying they were expecting more coming from Bong Joon-Ho; specially after \"Parasite\". But i think that is not fair for him. \"Parasite\" is one of those rare movies, that only gets made every few years. It's not realistic, nor fair, to expect every movie a director/writer releases, to be as good a masterpiece like \"Parasite\". I cannot wait to watch his next work."

It came off as forced and out of place in a setting when forced and out of place was the theme. I do not care what side of the political isle the message lines up with, I watch movies to get a fanciful break from reality. When I get movie makers political alignments shoved in my face I cannot stay with the fantasy of the movie. It is like Frodo pulling out a cell phone and ordering door dash."

      "rating": "3.5/5",
      "review": "Mickey 17 feels more spiritually connected to Bong Joon Ho's genre-bending works like The Host and Snowpiercer than to his Oscar-winning Parasite. While undeniably flawed and occasionally heavy-handed with its political satire, the film offers something fresh and exciting in the sci-fi landscape. The real standout is Robert Pattinson's remarkable performance as Mickey and his various clones. Each iteration feels distinctly different - a testament to Pattinson's range and commitment. When another Mickey appears on screen, you genuinely feel like you're watching a different person, despite the shared face. This virtuoso performance elevates the material considerably. As with many of Bong's English-language films, some of his trademark dark comedy doesn't quite translate with the same razor-sharp edge we've come to expect from his Korean productions. The nuanced absurdism that made The Host so memorable feels somewhat diluted here, perhaps lost in translation or cultural context. Still, there's an undeniable originality to Mickey 17 that keeps you engaged. The film's exploration of expendability and corporate exploitation resonates, even when the execution falters. It's imperfect sci-fi that's more forgiving in its genre, buoyed by creative world-building and Pattinson's multi-faceted turn. For those willing to embrace its flaws, Mickey 17 offers an intriguing addition to Bong's diverse filmography."

      "review": "‚ÄúWhen a director is given too much power‚Äù that is the lesson that Mickey 17 teaches us. Mickey 17 is one of the first big-budget movies to come out in 2025. Directed by Bong Joon Ho, the same person who directed the cinematic masterpieces such as Parasite, the movie came out with high hopes from both critics and audiences alike. Unfortunately, the movie was not able to come close to the hype it had garnered. Summary Mickey 17 follows the story of Mickey. A man who volunteers to become a test subject on a space mission to escape the people who are chasing him on earth. In the movie‚Äôs universe, humanity has discovered how to clone people and uses ‚Äòexpendables‚Äô (people that have the sole purpose of dying for scientific inquiry) to conduct experiments on the human body. Once the person dies, they can be cloned again, loaded with their past memories and used for future experiments. This goes wrong when the 17th version of Mickey is presumed to be dead and his 18th version is cloned. The movie then follows Mickey 17th as he returns to the ship and finds his place taken by his clone, Mickey 18th. World Building The movie does a good job of worldbuilding. A common mistakes that sci-fi movies make is to rely on exposition (people talking about the world around them) for worldbuilding instead of actually showing the world and its rules. Mickey 17 balances these 2 aspects well. From the start, we hear Mickey 17 as a inner monologue and are shown the things he talks about. This helps the audience understand the world without making it feel complicated. The problem happens, when you are an hour into the movie and Mickey is still monologueing. Representing a detailed description of the world and its rules is not necessarily a bad thing, done well, it can help the audience‚Äôs immersion. But when it takes an hour to explain the world and nothing important happens in the story other than Mickey 18th being formed (Which the audience already know about from the trailers), the audience tend to loose their attention and that point, no amount of fancy visuals can bring their attention back. WHAT, WHEN, WHY Every good movie needs to establish its What ‚Äî what the main character hopes to accomplish; its When ‚Äî the time by which they must achieve it; and its Why ‚Äî the reason it matters. Without establishing these, a movie ends up being disfocused and lost in its plot. If the audience do not have a clear goal that needs to be achieved then everything ends up feeling pointless. This is the biggest mistake that Mickey 17 makes. From start to end, not once does the movie establish a clear goal that the characters need to achieve and a time frame for them to achieve it. There are some implicit goals and this can work, if, there is only one implicit goal and it is not interfered with. A movie cannot have multiple, unclear, implicit goals that are competing with one another. First, Mickey 17th has the implicit goal of following Mickey 18th. Why must he follow him? Because it‚Äôs a clone and he should. But then they meet and the goal ends. Now what, now they want to kill the head of the ship. Why? Because the captain treats them like expendables, but then everyone on the ship treats them like that, so they should logically kill everyone. But then, they fail. Now, they must save humanity. Why are they the ones saving humanity? Because they are the main characters, but there is nothing special about them, they might be clones but they are still humans, that isn‚Äôt a special ability. Boo Joon Ho uses the entire movie to showcase this amazing and detailed world he has created, but he never gives the audience a clear goal that Mickey 17th needs to achieve in this world. Setups and Payoffs Every movie needs setups and payoffs. The movie setups the goals that need to be achieved and then works towards the final payoff. This concept isn‚Äôt just limited to goals, a movie can setup a certain metaphor or external element and then use it later (this becomes the payoff). Unfortunately, for Mickey 17, this setup and payoff element is not executed well. Every movie is made of 3 acts, it‚Äôs introduction, main part, conclusion. Mickey 17 loosely sets up metaphors and goals in it‚Äôs first act and then rushes to close them up in the third act. The second act adds nothing to the movie and then continues to conflict and ruin the one implicit goal the first act set up. If you ignore the second act of the movie, all of it‚Äôs confusion and contradiction then the movie ends up being quite focused. Because, at the end of the movie, the only goals that are achieved are those set up in the first act. The second act goals are just ignored and forgotten by the movie. Too many themes The movie tries to tackle a lot of themes. Where a good movie only needs to tackle one or at max 2 themes. Mickey 17 tries to take on 3 of them: Ethics and Morality, Church and State, Situations and the Poor. A movie like Mickey 17 could have easily stuck to the ethics of making new people with the same memories (Some complicated story building also shows that it is not even the exact same memories). The storybuilding is also used to tackle the poverty theme and how it forces people into unfavourable situations. But then the movie decided to add a third theme. How the church and religion influnce the decisions made by the state (the captain). This theme is then not tackled in any meaningful way. It is represented to show it exists and then nothing is done with it. So the third theme ends up complicating the message of the movie without showing any meaningful messages of its own. Conclusion In conclusion. The movie looks amazing, from it‚Äôs quality to the colour grading to the wardrobe choices. The acting in Mickey 17 is phenomenal. Robert Pattinson does an amazing job of bringing his character to life. But other than these, there are no pros to it. It is a disfocused mess with no meaning or goal to it. Even the character arc is a lousy and unjustified mess. If you love Robert Pattinson and his work then maybe give it a try, but for any reasons other than that, skip it."

The 5% I hated about the movie were Mark Ruffalo‚Äòs and Toni Collette‚Äòs badly overacted villains. Ruffalo tries to impersonate Trump, and fails badly. Their whole act just feels like a cheap shot at Trump, Republicans, and like an attempt to put christians in a bad light and get some laughs at their expense. It all fails badly and the movie would be perfect, if the villains had been as well written and acted as the rest of the characters. Instead we get some bad parodies by obviously hateful actors and/or writers. But overall a great movie."

The confliction only deepens more so since this is Bong Jong-Ho's follow-up from the masterpiece that is PARASITE. Otherall, not the worst for the year or as an Sci-Fi Comedy but will probably end up being Bong's worst like STOKER was for Chan Wook-Park."

Desde j√°, vou deixar claro que adorei o filme, e que deu pra notar nele a \"assinatura\" de Bong Joon-ho. O filme apresenta um futuro dist√≥pico bem elaborado, e imerge o espectador nele atrav√©s de imagens alucinantes (sem grandes exageros) e boa ambienta√ß√£o. Tamb√©m cria toda a \"mitologia\" (digamos assim), que n√£o √© muito complexa, nem mesmo muito realista, por√©m, n√£o vejo como um problema, pois o filme n√£o se leva √† s√©rio, adotando um tom c√¥mico, tanto atrav√©s das situa√ß√µes da trama e de certas \"piadas\", como tamb√©m pelo personagem principal Mickey 17 (principalmente por ele), que √© muito bem interpretado por Robert Pattinson. Esse personagem (Mickey 17) talvez pode n√£o agradar muitas pessoas pelo seu jeito excessivamente caricato, infantilizado e etc., mas consegue roubar nossa simpatia, e √© apoiado pelo tom do filme. O filme apresenta muitas cr√≠ticas e subtextos e at√© mesmo alegorias que enriquecem mais a obra: cr√≠tica social, pol√≠tica, religiosa (infelizmente para quem √© religioso) e at√© sobre coloniza√ß√£o e fascismo. As demais atua√ß√µes est√£o perfeitas, e quero destacar Mark Ruffalo, como o Sr. Marshall, ele √© perfeito: engra√ßado, rid√≠culo, vilanesco, quase que implac√°vel e babaca tamb√©m [kkkk]. Mas o mais impressionante √© a habilidade √∫nica de Bong Joon-ho (diretor) de extrair o m√°ximo das situa√ß√µes da trama, gerando tens√£o, alucina√ß√£o e prendendo o espectador at√© o fim, sempre explorando as rela√ß√µes humanas da forma mais \"roubada\" (no bom sentido) poss√≠vel. Por fim, n√£o chega a repetir a qualidade de Parasita, por√©m n√£o por dem√©rito, mas sim por m√©rito de Parasita. √â um filma√ßo, mas depende da sua identifica√ß√£o com a obra. Recomendo. Nota 8,6 e 4,5 estrelas aqui."

By the end of the movie, you had heroes, and villains, and a new adorable alien to root for. I recommend watching it with friends, and enjoying the unexpected."

Incredible direction, brilliant performance by Pattinson, and a fantastic Mark Ruffalo. A must-watch film, even more impactful in IMAX format."

In all seriousness, the film went between picking up in a few places to absolutely dragging and feeling like it would never end. There were sex scenes that I felt were unnecessary and did nothing for the plot, and the villain was lame and annoying. (Especially his wife.) There were a few funny moments, but other than that, the only good part of this entire movie were the creepers and the part where Mickey screams when he sees his double. The only thing I appreciated is the fact that they gave Mickey 18 a different (almost alter-ego) personality from Mickey 17, because even though they were they were the same individual in body, they were different people entirely in mind which made them unique and represented that each expendable was indeed their own person in a way."

You have to see this film, if only for the series of poor Mickeys, employed worse than disposable because infinitely reusable, who behave like a sheep and who are adorable.

It's a really interesting take on exploring space, the story is somewhat funny and the more it progress the more you develop a soft spot for Mickey and let not forget the crippers which are soooo cute... It's a great film to watch between Monday and Thursday not yet worthy of Friday but it has potential to be a good weekend comedic relief if you find it funny."

The narration of Robert Pattison forcing a nerdy American accent gives it an inauthenticity that runs through the film. I've seen it being compared to Terry Gillian but its lacks the surrealism, artistry and emotional heart of his work. Finally the message of colonialism and corrupt politicians is so basic it make you start to think starship troopers is highbrow.

The caricatures played by Marshal and his wife were ridiculous and yet closely resembling the current political leaders. Great job by those actors too.

The movie itself was not bad, it was pretty good. Robert Pattinson was incredible, the way he made Mickey 17 and Mickey 18 feel like completely different characters is just a testament to his incredible range and acting ability. Mark Ruffalo also did an amazing job as playing a snubby politician who only cares about himself and no one else, his character was extremely unlikable throughout the movie which was a good thing. I expected this movie to be about a guy, going on many adventures and dying and being reprinted each time, and for there to be this big bad. What we got instead was a \"civil war\" between Mickey 18 and Kenneth Marshall, and a few alien creatures who wanted peace. The acting and many scenes were done really well which made the movie enjoyable, just a little let down by the storyline. Overall this is a good movie but nothing too crazy."

I have to say movie hit a little too close to home, considering our current political environment. The movie is a good satire about where we could be in a few decades. It is a lot more like Arrival when I think about how aliens are portrayed. There is an actual story that makes sense. Actors are good, I cannot say if any of them were better than the others. All of them were very well picked. To my surprise, I discovered recently there is an actress of Romanian origin in it. Movie looks very well, it has very nice Star Wars like scenes and takes advantage of its imagery. It is well worth to be seen on a large screen.

Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette were a surprise for me, but they also did a decent job of being the absolute worst. The movie all around was worth the watch. The story was decent, but the themes of the film were screaming where a more reserved voice could have done the same. I would recommend and would even venture to watch again, despite some of the film's weaknesses."

The timing of this film‚Äôs release is especially poignant, resonating not only with the political climate of the United States but with the global instability that looms over us all. Mark Ruffalo‚Äôs performance is a standout, delivering a portrayal that is both chilling and captivating. It‚Äôs clear that he drew heavy inspiration from a certain real-life figure, infusing his character with an intensity that leaves little to the imagination about his motivations and the dark, twisted psyche that drives him. Robert Pattinson, meanwhile, delivers a stunning dual performance as the titular Mickey, skillfully breathing unique life into two distinct iterations of the same character. His nuanced portrayal showcases his ability to differentiate the two versions, making each one feel fresh and dynamic, a feat that adds layers to the film‚Äôs complex narrative. Like many of Bong Joon-ho‚Äôs films, Mickey 17 is a work that rewards multiple viewings. Its rich, thought-provoking story and underlying themes will unfold more with each watch, revealing new layers and deeper meanings. This is a film that stays with you, demanding both reflection and interpretation long after the credits roll."

I appreciate the filmmakers for taking creative risks and not playing it safe‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt a movie for the masses but for those willing to reflect on the world around them. After all, without critique, there‚Äôs no change."

The plot and concept are super cool 3. The visual effects are very cool. 4. I personally enjoyed Steven Yeun as Timo. Some things that were not as good were: 1. It was to long, they could have told the same story just as well in a movie that was 30 mins shorter. 2. Adding to no. 1 the length didn't feel like it added anything, there were parts that were genuinely just boring. 3. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Kenneth Marshall and Toni Collete's performance as Yifa were way to over the top and cringy, sure that might have been what they were going for, but it was just impossible to watch for almost the entire run time. 4. It wasn't funny, as a movie marketed as a comedy, none of the jokes were good. There were times when you can tell that they tried desperately to be funny but just weren't. Overall, I unfortunately wouldn't recommend it, I may be missing some stuff for reasons including I never read Mickey 7. But, it's safe to say, I didn't enjoy this one."

Is it a dystopian sci-fi or a comedy? The film seems to change direction every five minutes. There‚Äôs a main plot, then forty different subplots. The scenes lack connection, making it difficult to follow what‚Äôs happening. Characters are introduced only to be ignored and pushed into the background. Robert Pattinson as Mickey was the film‚Äôs saving grace, he did well with what he had, and the humour does help distract from the fact that you have no idea what you‚Äôre watching. The best thing about the ending was the credits, because the film dragged on endlessly during the final 15 when all it needed was a quick wrap-up. Instead, we got a circling mess. If you do watch this film, I recommend avoiding the cinema, so at least you can scroll through your phone during the many filler scenes."

Steven Yeun plays Timo, best friend to Mickey who is more like a frenemy to Mickey who is the better friend between the 2. My favorite character is Nasha -- Mickey's significant other.

Or perhaps the audience could've put it together themselves through flashbacks. The part of the evil inventor who cloned himself numerous times, that was used to explain why multiples is a bad thing was not necessary either. Just have them bring up in conversation why it is a good or bad thing. Or perhaps have them discuss their own standpoint on it. Same with the fact that the clone machine and the whole concept of being an expendable will bring up ethical problems and paradoxes, like of course it will. Let the characters discuss their own opinions on the matter, trying to argue why it should or shouldn't exist rather than just say it. Like people are smart enough to figure out its a bad thing, don't hit people in the face with \"you should think this is a bad thing\".

Maybe not, since the gradually changing personalities of the reprinted person seem to degrade like photocopies of photocopies. Is it smart or right to try to look for other worlds to colonize before we have fixed our own? And should we let just anyone go? If space travel is open to everyone, who manages the risks and rewards? Robert Pattinson shades each version of Mickey exceptionally well, although he never seems intelligent enough to be choosing his steps. Naomi Ackie couldn't decide between good cop and bad cop and all the way up to Mark Ruffalo's top-of-the-(weirdo)-heap leader there was a lot of unsubtle mixing of government and religion that made the backdrop of moral questioning look like Idiocracy. Add some screaming at the end about indigenous \"people\" reacting to us as aliens mitigated by socially repressed scientists and a shadow government that suddenly pops up to take over when the villain falls and honestly this movie is a bizarre mess."
