    "review": "In Sinners, director Ryan Coogler and star Michael B. Jordan reunite to deliver what may be their most spiritually charged and politically urgent work to date. More than a film, Sinners is a mirror‚Äîboldly reflecting the buried traumas and enduring strength of Black America. Jordan‚Äôs performance is raw and riveting, carrying a generational weight that never feels forced. Coogler‚Äôs direction transforms symbolic imagery‚Äîbaptismal water, fractured stained glass, the pulpit and the prison‚Äîinto poetic language. Each frame breathes with historical memory and present-day urgency. Rather than spoon-feed its audience, Sinners trusts us to sit in discomfort and revelation. For Black viewers, especially, it speaks directly and powerfully: a cinematic sermon that interrogates systems of sin and survival. Coogler doesn‚Äôt just tell a story‚Äîhe resurrects one. Without question, Sinners stands as one of the most meaningful cinematic achievements of the decade."

He made it so it was easy to distinguish the twins from each other from mannerisms. It is quite good to see Haley Steinfeld in a more mature role as she grows as an actress. I go back to the movie soundtrack constantly because that‚Äôs how much of a role the music played in the movie."

However, I think the director took too many liberties with what we have know for years about vampires, their strengths and weakness, no way the twin would have been able to best his vampire twin as the vampire is always stronger than a human. I think the story took too long to get to the action and was very slow and dull, also there were many more vampires than humans by the end of the movie so how the player survived was just not very believable."

With slick action sequences, a genuinely original story, and a cast of compelling, well-drawn characters, this film stands out as a bold and entertaining addition to the supernatural action lineup. The fight choreography is a highlight‚Äîbrutal, fast-paced, and beautifully shot. But what really elevates Sinners is its commitment to character. Each member of the ensemble feels distinct and layered, with motivations that make the drama hit just as hard as the violence. The world-building is sharp and creative, offering a new spin on vampire lore without feeling forced or gimmicky. There are a few pacing hiccups here and there, but overall the direction keeps things moving with confidence and energy. It‚Äôs stylish without being hollow, and fun without losing emotional stakes. A solid 4-star experience that proves there's still plenty of life left in the vampire genre when it's done right. Definitely worth a watch."

You will get 15 more minutes worth of movie which could be an opening for a Sinners 2. A lot of people walked out and missed it. Now on to the review. I haven‚Äôt seen movie reviews this good in a long time. You would think this movie will be a catalyst for world peace the way reviewers were talking. I went in skeptical because 99.9% of the time they are wrong. Well, this is the .1% they are correct. Visually stunning, well acted (Michael B. Jordan plays dual roles as the Smokestack twins and actually does it well), an original storyline and a killer soundtrack if you like blues music. The first act of the film is in no hurry to get to the second act. It‚Äôs when characters are introduced before heading towards the part of the movie you are waiting for. It‚Äôs necessary for the viewer to actually develop feelings for the characters. The movie merges the past, present, and future through music. In today‚Äôs political climate some may have problems with the honest portrayal of black history and its reality. It‚Äôs a shame I have to bring it up. Reviewers say this is the best movie of the year. I have to agree and I will raise it. This movie is an epic masterpiece and will be a classic. Oh yeah‚Ä¶. and there are vampires. Get your tickets now. This movie deserves to have Barbie numbers in ticket sales and I will be watching!"

For example if you‚Äôre going to make the opening seem like the whole movie is centred around Preachers special ability why barely address this in the film? The musical scene that tried to depict this was a good start but not enough to walk away with a clear understanding. I still don‚Äôt really get what his special ability was other than the literal dialogue. Could have been a larger part of the plot line. I feel like the slow build up of suspense was lacking for a film classified as thriller/horror. The first 2/3 of the movie felt like a meaningful timepiece drama and the final 3rd felt like it was an entirely different film. The vampires themselves felt more like satire than actual feared characters. Especially the twin. He was too likeable and familiar as someone meant to be feared. More work needed to be done to break down all of the rapport we built with him through out the film before trying to make us see him as a villain. The automation of the weapons/ modernisation of the gun violence felt out of place for the period. The use of electric guitar scores in crucial moments also fits with the above. Didn‚Äôt feel like it fit in for the time period. Plus the closing KKK scene felt like a desperate attempt to draw deeper meaning at the end. Instead just came off as a stereotypical shoot out scene trying to wear the dress of a deeper message. Overall poorly done. Foundations were there but fell massively short and all of the raving reviews make me wonder if we watched the same film."

Eles resolvem abrir um clube de blues para a comunidade negra local, por√©m um mal mais antigo est√° √† espreita. Ryan Coogler est√° se tornando uma das vozes negras mais potentes no cinema americano. Depois de continuar a franquia Rocky, criando uma nova com o filho do Apolo Creed e fazer um dos melhores filmes de super-her√≥is, apresentando o Pantera Negra, dando um grande destaque a ele, Coogler nos traz um filme de vampiros, mas com uma leitura social extremamente importante. Aqui ele retorna aos anos 30. O mundo tinha sa√≠do de uma guerra, mas logo entraria em outra. Sementes come√ßavam a ser plantadas referentes aos direitos negros em uma regi√£o extremamente preconceituosa e atrasada. O clube dos irm√£os Smoke e Stack √© um lugar de celebra√ß√£o da cultura negra, como na cena mais famosa do filme, onde o personagem de Miles Caton se apresenta e se torna um gri√¥, abrindo portas para o passado e futuro, onde a m√∫sica e a dan√ßa se misturam em √©pocas e estilos diferentes. Mas tamb√©m a cultura asi√°tica √© homenageada. J√° √© uma das cenas mais belas e fortes desse ano. Mas al√©m de ser um local de celebra√ß√£o, √© um local de resist√™ncia. Os vampiros representam n√£o somente a amea√ßa √†quele grupo de pessoas, mas tamb√©m uma amea√ßa √† liberdade que eles constru√≠ram naquele lugar, naquela noite. √â muito interessante fazer uma rela√ß√£o entre a tradi√ß√£o que um vampiro tem que receber a permiss√£o do dono da casa para poder entrar e os negros n√£o terem o direito de entrar em todos os lugares. Ou de haver lugares separados para eles. E ao serem mordidos e transformados em vampiros, os negros perdiam sua identidade, tornando-se um s√≥ com o personagem de Jack O'Connell, como na cena onde uma roda se forma em torno dele e todos cantam aquela can√ß√£o irlandesa, como se falasse a todos eles igual. Outro ponto extremamente positivo √© a trilha sonora e as can√ß√µes se encaixam perfeitamente bem, quase tornando o filme um musical, onde blues, country e can√ß√µes tradicionais se misturam, unindo-se nos seus pontos comuns. Al√©m do estilo de Coogler ser bastante percept√≠vel, √© claro que conseguimos ver influ√™ncias de Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino e Jordan Peele. O interessante √© que o filme ocorre em um √∫nico dia, da compra da serraria pelos g√™meos, at√© o nascer do outro dia. Apenas um dia pode ser fugaz, mas aqui foi eterno. Parab√©ns, Ryan Coogler."

    "review": "This is one of the best movies I've seen in years! The strong black southern cultural ties and spirituality are so beautifully represented here. Coogler teamed up with his longterm collaborator Ludwig Goransson who delivers another unforgettable score. The music basically serves as its own character and is an essential aspect of the story. There is a single-shot scene which depicts Sammie performing on his guitar during opening night at the juke joint (yes, THAT scene... iykyk) that is truly jaw-dropping. It currently lives rent-free in my mind. Coogler is a genius. Period. Throughout the movie, Coogler follows classic vampires rules (Thank God) and delivers some genuine jump scares along the way. However, the vampires are not just scary, but also fun and interesting. The end of the movie serves a conclusion that is both satisfying and heart-warming for these unforgettable characters. And those of us who still crave the Marvel-esc mid and end-credits scenes will be delighted with the end of this movie. Go see it in theaters! This is a must-see."

For example, the intergenerational/intercultural dance hall scene was a lovely concept, but I thought the implementation was noisy both visually and auditorily in a way that turned an opportunity for a powerful moment into mush. It also defined a sort of spiritual power in the verse that never really went anywhere. Although I wouldn't consider myself a blues fan, the music in this film was fantastic. Last, I'll note that this film is a victim of common pitfalls in horror movies -- the underpowered protagonists are written into a corner multiple times where there is no believable route for survival and the assaulting antagonists turn tail and run or monologue for no reason. Combat choreography was nonsensical, bordering on laughably bad at times, and the conclusion to the fight against the \"big bad\" didn't make a lick of sense."

Some, almost most , of the music didn't fit the period either, coming years later. Most folks wouldn't though I do know who Charlie Patton was and the legend of Robert Johnson who it is said sold his soul to the Devil. There was another scene with the cloggers that made me laugh [no spoilers], which I don't think was the intended effect. When it descended into Vampire lore, it got much better. I am a musician and so appreciated the film on a different level. 'The Blues' is a well-spring, one of the mothers of music.This at times felt like a homage to that.. It was a nice touch adding Buddy Guy at the end..There is another movie.. The Honey Dripper.. another juke joint, starring Danny Glover."

The movie is not afraid to spell out it's message and goes very intense, and isn't shy to be silly or even trashy at some moments. Overall it was a nice experience watching it. What keeps this movie from being perfect is that the tone of the movie is all over the place, sometimes is too serious and sometimes too silly, maybe more consistency on this aspect would make it more cohesive and help suspend the disbelief a bit more."

We‚Äôre introduced to a cast of morally grey gangsters with rich backstories and stylish direction that hints at something special. The cinematography is slick, the pacing tight, and the tension real. For the first 45 minutes, Sinners seems like a hidden gem. Then it crashes‚Äîhard. Seemingly out of nowhere, the film takes a sharp, unearned left turn into a full-blown vampire musical, complete with fanged jazz hands and lip-synced blood ballads. The shift in genre isn‚Äôt clever or bold‚Äîit‚Äôs chaotic and confusing. Characters who were once nuanced criminals are suddenly breaking into poorly written songs about eternal damnation and heartbreak in dimly lit nightclubs. It‚Äôs as if The Godfather had a baby with High School Musical‚Äîbut left the script unfinished. The most frustrating part? The original plot is simply abandoned. Key storylines are never resolved, and several characters just vanish without explanation. It‚Äôs clear that either the writers lost control, or a completely different script was stapled on in post-production. There‚Äôs potential buried somewhere in Sinners, but it‚Äôs drowned in fake blood, pitchy vocals, and baffling creative choices. Unless you enjoy watching a promising movie derail into an incoherent musical fever dream, this one is best left in the crypt."
