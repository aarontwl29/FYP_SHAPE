      "review": "Oppenheimer is a hallmark for Nolan and his bludgeoning filmography. The film boasts many qualities. Personally I loved the performances everyone killed it, nailed their roles. The score, sound design is simply immaculate. Cinematography is consummate in terms of lighting, framing, clarity/resolution. The film looks so authentic in that my suspension of disbelief never declined whilst watching the film unfold. The set pieces, scenery and overall production value is perhaps the best of any Nolan picture. He’s certainly outdone himself in terms of technical skill, so masterful. I wouldn’t say it’s his best film but it’s certainly up there. Inception takes the cake for me and I still prefer Tenet over this. Oppenheimer doesn’t necessarily surpass expectations but it definitely meets them. 8/10"

      "review": "Oppenheimer: A Riveting Portrait of Power, Science, and Human Complexity Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a towering achievement in modern cinema, combining history, psychology, and science into a gripping narrative. The film, based on the biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, explores the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who led the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer doesn’t just show a series of historical events; it dives deep into the emotional and ethical struggles of the people behind one of the most world-altering inventions in history: the atomic bomb. Nolan crafts a story that feels as urgent and relevant today as it was in Oppenheimer’s own lifetime, and the complicated relationships at the heart of the film only make the story even more powerful. If I were to rate this movie, I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars, and here’s why. First, the movie’s relevance to today’s world is impossible to ignore. Even though Oppenheimer is set in the 1930s and 1940s, the questions it raises about science, power, and morality still apply. We live in a time where technology—like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and nuclear weapons—is advancing faster than our ability to regulate it. Watching Oppenheimer and his team wrestle with the implications of unleashing such destructive power feels eerily similar to the conversations happening in politics and science today. The movie doesn’t glorify the invention of the atomic bomb. Instead, it shows how much guilt and internal conflict it created for those involved. Nolan captures the terrifying realization that scientific breakthroughs often come with consequences nobody can fully predict. By showing this, Oppenheimer pushes viewers to think about the responsibility that comes with knowledge—a message that feels more urgent than ever. Another reason Oppenheimer hits so hard is because of its focus on human relationships. The movie makes it clear that history isn’t just shaped by big ideas and explosions; it’s shaped by deeply flawed people making impossible decisions. Oppenheimer himself, played brilliantly by Cillian Murphy, is portrayed as a man constantly torn between loyalty, ambition, love, and fear. His relationship with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) is intense but destructive, revealing his emotional instability. Meanwhile, his marriage to Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt) shows a different kind of complicated bond, full of resentment, betrayal, and a shared burden. These relationships ground the movie in real human emotion. They remind us that behind every historic moment are people trying—and often failing—to balance their personal lives with the demands of history. The dynamic between Oppenheimer and General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) also stands out. Their relationship is not based on friendship but mutual need and begrudging respect. Groves needs Oppenheimer’s mind; Oppenheimer needs Groves’ authority. Watching their uneasy partnership unfold adds another layer to the movie’s tension. Every relationship in Oppenheimer is laced with distrust, longing, or fear, showing how isolation and paranoia can eat away at even the strongest personalities. Nolan doesn’t just give us history; he gives us the loneliness and pressure that history-makers live through, which makes the story feel alive and heartbreaking. The film’s technical achievements also deserve a lot of credit. From the stunning practical effects that recreate the Trinity Test explosion to Ludwig Göransson’s haunting score, every detail adds to the atmosphere of dread and awe. Nolan famously avoided using CGI for the bomb scenes, and the results are jaw-dropping. The sound design is just as powerful—sometimes cutting out completely to force the audience to sit with the silence of devastation. All these elements make Oppenheimer an intense, almost overwhelming sensory experience that mirrors the emotional storm inside its main character. As for the performances, Cillian Murphy delivers one of the best portrayals of internal conflict I’ve seen in years. He doesn’t make Oppenheimer a hero or a villain; he makes him human. You can see the weight of his choices eating at him from the inside out. Robert Downey Jr. also gives a phenomenal performance as Lewis Strauss, showing how personal grudges and ambition can twist the course of history. The entire supporting cast is strong, but it’s Murphy who carries the movie, giving it its emotional center. Now, why not a full 5 stars? While Oppenheimer is an incredible film, it can feel a bit overwhelming, especially in its final act. The non-linear structure—jumping between timelines and perspectives—can be confusing if you’re not paying close attention. Some audience members might find the second half, which focuses heavily on political hearings and betrayals, to drag compared to the intense first half that leads up to the bomb’s creation. While I personally found the political drama fascinating, I can see how it might lose the emotional momentum for some viewers. A slightly tighter edit or a little more focus could have made the film perfect. Still, these are small criticisms compared to how much the movie accomplishes. In conclusion, Oppenheimer is a masterful film that deserves most of the praise it’s received. It’s relevant because it forces us to think about the cost of progress and the dangers of unchecked ambition. The focus on relationships keeps the story personal, emotional, and painfully real. While it’s not a perfect film, it’s about as close as a historical drama can get. I would confidently give Oppenheimer a 4.5 out of 5 stars for its emotional depth, technical brilliance, and its powerful reminder that history is written not just by events, but by the people who live through them."

This film filled in all the details, maybe a little too much; the three hours started to drag a little until the actual work began in Los Alamos. The rest was the political setup (for and against him) in his achievement of both the physical and emotional accomplishments. In the acting department, the movie was loaded with heavy hitters. However, Cillian Murphy pretty well stole the show. As I said, I wasn't familiar with th personal side of Oppenheimer, but somehow, Mr. Murphy brought him to life. A tremendous performance."

The first half is a bit choppy and can be a bit disengaging since it's not in Nolan's strengths to write emotional arcs well, but the second half is tightly packed and tense, making you feel the emotions and the turmoil of a man that let humans destroy themselves. The practical effects and score are top notch, and you will be left speechless when the Trinity test is shown. Cillian, Emily, Florence and RDJ nail their roles with outstanding performances, and there are genuine moments where you forget these are actors and actually believe what they are saying. If only the first half was written better, it would be a 5 star film."

Don’t get me wrong, the political narrative is important, but after a while, it started to feel like an endless game of ‘who can talk the longest about atomic politics.’ By the time the big moment came, I was ready to leave and go home"

Far from Nolan’s best work (I would put it fourth in his filmography- after Insomnia, Intersetellar, and Memento, just ahead of The Prestige), but an incredible collection of fantastic direction, cinematography, and outstanding performances. My only real nitpicks would be a few casting choices. Pugh and Damon are generally, genuinely solid actors, but they were grossly overshadowed by career-best performances from Murphy, RDJ, and Blunt. And also, the odd- almost inexplicable- sort of aversion to the 15 kiloton elephant in the room. Without spoilers, I’ll just say that I don’t feel enough attention was given to the people of, and impact on, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was definitely a (non-BIPOC) US-centric lens through which the story was being told. And while that doesn’t diminish the film per se, the omission is definitely, distractingly noticeable. Overall, Oppenheimer is a masterfully done, engaging, and “important” film. I don’t think it’ll have the staying power and cultural impact (no pun intended) as its pink-tinted box office competition, but still an amazing cinematic depiction of (one of) the most devastatingly, irrevocably horrific moments of the 20th Century."

The movie is 3 hours long and yet you never feel the time since the pacing is written and directed so tightly. Every scene is a page-turner and not one second of screentime is wasted. Just like nuclear physics, the movie itself feels like a paradox that works with how it’s presented and engages us with the titular protagonist. It’s hypnotically beautiful, yet hauntingly hilling and sinister. Oppenheimer himself is highly opinionated and strong wiled, and yet by the end he stands for nothing and lets everyone push him around for their own sinister means until they’ve lost their use for him and leave him to the wolves for the catastrophic consequences of their scientific breakthrough used for reprehensible intentions. A brilliant scientific mind that was destined for greatness, but threw personal caution and wisdom out of the wind, falling into the hands of higher authorities that could mend and use him for however they liked. The cast is packed with great actors, and everyone gives a stellar performance. The direction is fantastic with very dynamic camera work, sound design, lighting/color motifs, convincing practical effects/set pieces, and a beautifully ethereal soundtrack that all culminate in a truly theatrical experience that left the entire theater silent by the end. Truly a worthy box office companion to Barbie! (just make sure you don’t watch Barbie AFTER Oppenheimer, or else you might get some serious emotional whiplash)."

The movie works hard to try to make you feel some situations are very dramatic when they are not. It feels self-indulgent. Drama is turned up to 11 in the wrong way. I think it was a good movie but not one I would watch again and I don't think it will be remembered as it was regarded when it was released."

So many scenes with exposition and dialogue. Learning more about this pivotal time in history was interesting. Also the political witch hunting shows that what happens in often only as important as the story that gets told about what happens, and that has not changed. The end of World War 2, the Cold War, and the political stand off that followed all hinge on this part of history. The relative peace, largely brokered and maintained by the United States, since World War 2 is unprecedented. Large political powers do not and have not taken territory since the advent of these large scale weapons by force from other large powers, until just recently. It is important to understand why, and to not abandon that because the U.S. is \"owed\" something by the rest of the world."

Es una película densa en términos de contenido, pero si se le dedica la suficiente atención, resulta gratificante y profundamente emocional. Adoré los recursos que utilizó; en especial para señalar la culpa que sentía Oppi: las luces que simulaban la bomba cuando se sentía presionado, la sobreposición de gritos de miedo en momentos que \"Deberían\" ser gratificantes. Nolan hizo un excelente trabajo convirtiendo una biografía y un suceso histórico importante (algo generalmente serio y a veces, aburrido) en una historia atrapante en la que conectas con los sentimientos del protagonista. . Éste género no es mi favorito, por eso para mí no es la mejor de las mejores obras cinematográficas, pero es intensa, y eso es lo que hace a una película (y a su director) magistral."

The plot is excitingly brought to life by an outstanding cast. Cinema was alive and well in 2023 and this is the best example of that. This is one of the top 3 greatest films of this century and Christopher Nolan's magnum opus. A true masterpiece! Oppenheimer is easily one of the most perfect motion pictures ever conceived.

And I feel like there are some characters are totally miscasted and misplaced, like RDJ, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon. Have no idea why are they in the movie. They look so awkward and out of place in the movie. And they look even weirder when they are put aside each other. All solid actors, but poorly casted into roles that they are not suited for. Poor casting. Cillian Murphy's performance is mixed. Half of the movie he's just staring into nothing, the other he's mumbling awkward dialogues that sound nothing like the real Oppenheimer would say. Not his best performance even though he won an Oscar for it. Music is superb. Not being used enough in the movie. Should have made the score louder."

The soundtrack alone was a masterpiece, weaving perfectly with the gravity of World War II’s scientific breakthroughs. As a biology major, seeing science—world-changing, universe-altering science—brought to life with such intensity was like watching my academic passions explode on screen. And then there’s Cillian Murphy. His portrayal of Oppenheimer was so captivating that it genuinely made me feel like I fell in love with the entire experience. 5/5 stars doesn’t even come close to doing it justice. This film is a triumph in every sense!"

Oppenheimer is a flawed man, that did things most would characterize as being an utterly immoral character. What you decide is his immoral actions, can vary wildly from person to person. It tells the story of a brilliant man, that made choices both for his country and for himself, that ultimately prove to have drastic consequences. Nolan falls into some of his typical issues, where he makes some aspects trite. But, the overall story is so great, and the performances within are so great, it's easy to overlook those flaws. It's another great Nolan movie, that far surpasses his previous flubs like with Tenet."

Anyone who doesn’t include this in their best of 2023 or best of the 20th century is a hack, this is a perfect example of how to make cinemetic perfection of a biopic about the inventor of the atomic bomb 💣💥 i loved watching every single one of it it lasts almost four hours and I didn’t care because it captivated my interest the cast enesemble is astonishing I love how they got popular actors to be in this work of cinemetic excellence. I managed to watch this in an imax theater where you can hear the intriguing and visual sound effects and boy where they just outstanding, the acting is soo good one could already even call this the best acted movie ever. Cillian Murphy did a great job playing j Robert Oppenheimer and he deserved his Oscar for it, Emily blunt, josh hartnet, Matt Damon and everyone else was brilliant in this but my favorite actor was RDJ ( Robert Downey jr ) he was by far the best actor in this I loved his portrayal of Lewis Strauss the business man and admiral behind his help with oppenheimer in his clearance and how at the end he nearly betrayed him by revoking it just like how this happened in real life it was like he was the villain. It was a huge delight to see RDJ have an award worthy comeback 🎭 performance he manages to redeem after that missfire that was Doolittle His performance as him was astonishing and he deserved the best supporting actor Oscar. The special effects were also really good and I’m dissapointment that it didn’t get an Oscar nom for that category but other than that This was a thought provoking, emotionally gripping epic thriller and deserved every single one of its academy award 🥇 nominations and Wins especially for best director for Nolan his direction was tremendous and gave out great performance from the all star cast not one of them was wasted and thanks to the material they were given they all did a phenomenal job and everything about it worked. It is so far the best movie of the 2020s and it’s a film everyone in this world especially critics, buffs, geeks and any other film fan and viewer must see at all costs it deserved every movie award possible this one without a doubt gets a perfect score of 10/10 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️🎖️🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅"

Christopher Nolan succeeded and this film deserves all the praise that it gets. Yes, it is exhausting to get through, but that is kind of the point. There is not a single bad performance in the bunch. RDJ poured his heart into the role, especially as an old man. Cillian Murphy was crisp and brilliant. Matt Damon was powerful. Emily Blunt was jaw-dropping, specifically in the courtroom scene. While every performance was extraordinary, I'm not sure that every character was necessary. I understand that Nolan wanted to stay true to the source material, but every five minutes there would be an important new name and face. I felt like I needed to take notes on each character. The film does an admirable job of navigating different timelines and the complicated elements of this true story. The pacing really picks up once Matt Damon's character in introduced and kept my attention throughout. That being said, and I hate to say it, but I think that I would have liked the project more as a 4 part series. The film is visually impressive and the score sets the stage throughout. Though the idea of Oppenheimer is larger than life, the movie (much like the lead character) truly succeeds is in the quiet moments. Best Character: Oppenheimer Best Quote: \"Amateurs seek the sun.

Robert Oppenheimer’s mind and life story, from his early studies on physics to his late life events after the end of WWII and the scrutiny of his deeds during said war. Christopher Nolan, the director, is no newbie to the cinema scene. His efforts to create a masterpiece using no CGI in a century when most movies rely on it for sure add to the greatness of the film, and haven’t gone unnoticed to the film critics¹. The soundtrack is awesome, there are lots of moments when the immersiveness offered by this piece of art goes beyond any expectation, and the tunes produced by Hans Zimmer, one of the most regarded composers in Hollywood, really enhance the whole experience. In fact, the compositions were so magnificent that they even earned Zimmer the Oscar for Best Original Soundtrack."

Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer himself—man, that fella can act! He was just somethin' special, lke you could see the weight of the world on his shoulders. I felt for him every step of the way. It's almst hard to believe our government could do such thing! And then there’s Emily Blunt—she gave a real touchin’ performance as Oppenheimer’s wife. She was strong, but you could see the struggle too. It was powerful. I don’t know how she does it, but that woman can sure pull at your heartstrings. Now lemme tell ya, Robert Downey Jr., he flat out blew me away. I know everyone talks about him as Iron Man, but this was different. His role here was spectacular, like nothin' I’ve ever seen from him before. I really liked him as Sherlock but that was something different. He was just so dang good at playin’ someone you didn’t know if you should trust or not. It was a whole new side of RDJ, and I’m here for it. The movie ain’t just about science—it’s about the people behind it all, their lives, their struggles, and what it meant for the world. It made me think about history in a way I never did before, and that’s sayin’ somethin’. The way they showed how one decision could change everything—it’s powerful stuff. \"Oppenheimer\" ain’t your typical popcorn flick, but boy is it a must-see. The acting was top notch, and it left me thinkin’ long after the credits rolled. It’s one of them movies that sticks with ya."

The characters, despite their fascinating real-life counterparts, come across as cold and distant, while the relentless score seems to be compensating for the film’s lack of emotional depth.

All that being said, I thought Oppenheimer was good, but not great. I wasn't wowed by it. I wasn't moved emotionally by it. I really didn't like the way the story was written. It was an ok movie, but I'm pretty sure I'll never watch it again."

Nolan was masterful in his directing of the character, showing how troubled he became after his achievements in leading a team of scientists to develop the nuclear bomb. Emily Blunt as Kitty was also heart-wrenching in her performance as she backed up her husband later in life because he couldn’t face the consequences of his actions. It was a fabulous drama that I wish I saw on the big screen, especially with the beautiful score. Basically this was a perfect movie without unnecessary action, violence or facts about the true story. Overall — it’s bittersweet. Five stars and an absolute must see!"

What's amazing is the movie's popularity with the public. \"Oppenheimer\" is a complicated story about complicated topics with complicated characters involved and, by some miracle, the public is paying attention. At the end of the movie, the audience is reminded that the story hasn't ended. It's possible that somebody will explode a nuclear gadget that will start a global holocaust. If the public understands that message, and if people move in the right way, there's hope for humanity."

      "review": "ChatGPT Oppenheimer Review: Cillian Murphy's Atomic Performance and His Valorant Odyssey Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer detonates onto the screen with all the explosive force one would expect from a film exploring the moral and scientific complexities of the Manhattan Project. At its heart is Cillian Murphy, delivering a performance that glows with the intensity of a thousand suns. As J. Robert Oppenheimer, Murphy navigates the treacherous waters of scientific ambition and ethical dilemma with a nuanced grace that cements his status as one of cinema's foremost talents. Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is a masterclass in subtlety and depth. His ability to convey the weight of responsibility, the moral quandaries, and the sheer intellectual curiosity that defined Oppenheimer's character is spellbinding. From the laboratories of Los Alamos to the corridors of power in Washington, Murphy's Oppenheimer is a man torn between duty and conscience, his internal struggles etched across his face like shadows cast by a mushroom cloud. However, while Murphy effortlessly navigates the complexities of nuclear physics on screen, one wonders if his talents extend to the virtual battlefield of Valorant. In a hypothetical scenario where Oppenheimer takes a break from splitting atoms to split heads, Murphy's tactical acumen seems to falter. His character's decisions in high-stakes Valorant matches often leave teammates scratching their heads, wondering if they're witnessing the birth of a new meta or just Murphy's interpretation of virtual chaos theory. In one memorable scene, as Oppenheimer faces off against rival physicists in a virtual arena, Murphy's aim struggles to match the precision of his intellectual prowess. His character's strategic maneuvers resemble more of a calculated retreat than a blitzkrieg assault, prompting speculation that perhaps Oppenheimer's mind was too occupied with the secrets of the universe to focus on headshots. Nonetheless, Oppenheimer is a triumph of storytelling and visual spectacle. Nolan's direction, combined with Hans Zimmer's haunting score, creates an atmosphere that is as tense as it is awe-inspiring. Murphy's performance anchors the film, his portrayal of Oppenheimer's inner turmoil resonating long after the credits roll. In conclusion, Oppenheimer stands as a testament to the power of cinema to explore the complexities of human ambition and ethical responsibility. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is a triumph, showcasing his ability to inhabit characters with depth and authenticity. And while his Valorant skills may not be ready to launch a tactical nuke, Murphy's performance in Oppenheimer is nothing short of explosive. So, whether you're a history buff, a science enthusiast, or just someone looking for a riveting cinematic experience, Oppenheimer delivers on all fronts. Just don't expect Murphy to carry your Valorant team anytime soon — unless, of course, nuclear physics suddenly becomes a prerequisite for clutching rounds."

I am also rather disappointed that there wasn't more in depth look at the actual physics development of the bomb...like \"Fat Man and Little Boy\"; the only hint that Little Boy even existed was that there was a smaller, longer box leaving on the transport from Los Alamos, and a drawing on a chalk board early in the development."

Tech departments are as always top notch but particularly Cinematography and Sound gave it a unique flavour. Finally, no doubt one of the best masterpieces from this new age genius.

Oppenheimer's so good, and Nolan's so good at structuring a story, that you seriously forget about the actual detonation of the bomb. The point of the movie isn't even the most fascinating part- that's how good this film is. Oppenheimer does a great job teaching you parts of history without boring you, or dragging you along, similar to \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\" There are just enough plot points in the movie to keep your mind moving along that you stay energized and intrigued, but not too many that you forget what we're doing. Stunningly enough, this 3-hour epic is very rewatchable, in spite of it's mammoth size."

If the movie were just base don this it would still be important but this is a triumphant piece of filmmaking. It is brilliantly Directed, written, filmed, and musically scored. This movie is filled with terrific and award winning performances. Its use of editing for the time transitions is distinctly Christopher Nolan. The movie tells an important story in a sophisticated way to pays proper homage to the subject matter and to the science. Much of it is complex but told in a digestible fashion. The story of the American fear in the infancy of the Cold War is powerful. The cast is stellar, stellar. stellar."

This movie won an Oscar bc of the all star cast, good acting, and ridiculously fast dialogue that deceives viewers into thinking they are intelligent. At the same time, it moves too slowly. Emily Blunt was an implosion herself. Pugh was just naked. I don’t know, movies aren’t what they used to be, that’s for sure."

      "review": "The film “Oppenheimer” came out july 20th in 2023. It’s directed by Christopher Nolan. The genre of Oppenheimer is thriller and historical drama. It was filmed in the US, New Mexico. \"Oppenheimer\" follows the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist, who played a crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb. The film explores Oppenheimer's complex personality, his moral and ethical dilemmas, and his ultimate realization of the devastating consequences of his scientific achievements. In \"Oppenheimer,\" the lead role is portrayed by a talented actor who embodies the complex character of J. Robert Oppenheimer with depth and nuance. The actor captures Oppenheimer's intelligence, ambition, inner conflicts, and moral dilemmas, bringing the character to life on screen. The supporting roles in the film play key roles in shaping Oppenheimer's story and providing context for his decisions and actions. In terms of special effects and graphics, \"Oppenheimer\" utilizes a combination of practical effects, computer-generated imagery (CGI), and visual effects to recreate the historical settings and events depicted in the film. The graphics in \"Oppenheimer\" are designed to support the storytelling and enhance the audience's understanding of the complex scientific concepts and historical events depicted in the film. As a regular viewer, I would highly recommend watching \"Oppenheimer\". The film delves into the fascinating story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a complex figure who played a pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. \"Oppenheimer\" offers a thought-provoking exploration of a significant moment in history, shedding light on the complexities of scientific advancement and its ethical implications. If you enjoy historical dramas with strong performances and visually stunning effects, \"Oppenheimer\" is definitely worth watching. It will leave you with a deeper understanding of the man behind the atomic bomb and the impact of his work on the world."

Drawing inspiration from the annals of history, Nolan embarks on an audacious journey akin to the inception of biographical storytelling. Set against the backdrop of the enigmatic Manhattan Project, Nolan seamlessly merges elements of historical drama with his signature brand of cerebral cinema. With meticulous attention to detail, he crafts a narrative tapestry that immerses viewers in the clandestine world of scientific endeavor and moral quandaries. Central to the film's success is Nolan's impeccable casting choices, which elevate the storytelling to new heights. Each member of the ensemble delivers a tour de force performance, breathing life into their respective characters with nuance and gravitas. In \"The Manhattan Project,\" Nolan once again proves himself a virtuoso of the silver screen, delivering a cinematic experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant. With its spellbinding visuals, thought-provoking themes, and stellar performances, this film stands as a testament to Nolan's enduring legacy as one of contemporary cinema's foremost auteurs."

Unless it is something like a war movie to show the importance & shock effect of starvation upon prisoners. The direction of Oppenheimer is dis-jointed & the scenes jump around in an unfocused disconnected way, it requires a lot of concentration to understand what is going on; even for an intelligent person. I'm struggling to understand how it is that this film has won multiple awards. I might persevere to finish it - but it is a very disappointing take on an important part of history. Certainly it does not compare to other movies such as Schindler's List.

Oppenheimer is leagues better than its counterpart Barbie, given its epic scale and an all-star ensemble that Robert Altman would be proud of. Despite a mammoth runtime, this film never becomes boring. Christopher Nolan takes a similar approach to David Fincher when making this biopic, dramatizing it until it plays out like a fast-paced thriller. It was interesting to learn of the historical events that may lead to humanity's destruction, a theme that lingers like a dark cloud over the film and makes you think. Not something I can often say about a film in a shallow modern industry. Another point: seeing every other famous actor on the planet get a chance to shine in this film was half the fun. It's always a joy to see Jason Clarke bully Cillian Murphy one second, then see Robert Downey Jr. have a breakdown while Alden Ehrenreich taunts him the next. I could watch the last 30-60 minutes of Oppenheimer endlessly. Two negative comments about the film: firstly, Florence Pugh is overly sexualized. She's naked for an uncomfortably large amount of her screentime for reasons that I personally cannot grasp. Secondly (and this is only minor), I find it triggering that Ehrenreich's character doesn't have a name. It humours me that an only moderately known actor's unnamed and undeveloped character has more lines and screentime than the one and only Casey Affleck's character. This is only me nitpicking an otherwise flawless movie. Like Oliver Stone's JFK, it's a three hour masterpiece where the entire cast is a recognizable name or face. This is an oasis in a desert of 2020s trash."

This film is like a Rubik's Cube dipped in quantum physics and sprinkled with existential dread – not your typical Saturday night rom-com, that's for sure. If you're the type who still thinks 2+2 equals fish and that the Earth is flat because you've never left your hometown, this movie might be a bit of a brain workout.

Then there are silly romantic scenes, hastily done, some with unwholesome attempts at \"artistic\" character depictions. There are way too many characters on the whole and way too many elements; add to that the constant change of scenes (past/present) and the movie becomes really difficult to follow. Even worse, the main guy just hangs around not saying much—except in the flashbacks. And what about people who don't know who Hahn, Heisenberg, etc are? Those mentions are probably just to make the movie sound like it deals with science. The movie is a mess—a hotchpotch of personality portraits, politics, law, \"science,\" history, and at least five more things I could list. Weave in random bits about communism vs the establishment, Germans vs Americans, Jews vs non-Jews, and so forth and so on. At one point, a woman asks Oppenheimer in a romantic(!) way: \"Can you explain quantum mechanics to me?\" Dr. O actually responds by telling her something factual but really ordinary to someone who knows any physics. Oof, that was rotten!"

Honestly a movie for the ages that will not be forgotten like the Godfather or Saving Private Ryan. This is why Christopher Nolan movies are the best, it is because of the cinematography. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. are definitely the standout actors for this movie. I love WWII it has so many parts to it and the Atomic Bomb takes one of the key roles in WWII. Another thing that I like is that it shows the guilt of Oppenheimer after he creates the bomb and becomes the ender of so many lives and most likely the world as we know it. The run time is unbearable, but it is so intense it goes by very fast. Along with Napoleon and John Wick 4 these are my picks for movie of the year, but most of all I hope it goes to Oppenheimer. In total a must-see movie for any movie lover and my pick for best movie of all time. Edit: it won the movie of the year:)"

My interpretation, of course - others have had meaningful discussions on the movie dealing with moral and actual consequences, in a world without heroes). Oppenheimer is arguably Nolan at his peak (high praise from the guy who loved The Dark Knight), building an engaging world with a deep introspection that never feels too heavy. Nolan might be slightly generous to Oppenheimer, but the movie itself never feels like it takes sides. Oppenheimer's youth, growth, and involvement in the Manhattan Project, and the subsequent related congressional hearing of Lewis Strauss are handled masterfully. The cast is also great, though I was a mite disappointed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt whose roles seemed muted. But the rest of the cast shone, and shone in concert together, underpinned by a script that for once isn't expository. All in all, it's a deeply thoughtful movie that is also beautifully constructed and shot, and ranks up there as one of the best movies of the 2020s (not just 2023). You'll feel the 3 hours, but you won't regret it."

Although, imo it’s my movie of the year and it may not be close with the movie hot-period coming to an end. I will say that it’s a slow movie that I may watch less than 20 times in my lifetime but i will enjoy it every single time. to wrap it up, I think it was for sure one of my most favorable in-theater experiences and I recommend it to anyone and everyone!

On the subject of audio, the dialogue was whispered in some places and then would follow with deafening sounds.

The best scenes, I found, were at the end, during the hearings examining Oppenheimer alleged communist sympathies and the machinations of his enemies (Strauss) to ruin his reputation. On the whole the verdict of the film is: the invention of the atom bomb was a disaster and Oppenheimer himself felt distinctly ambivalent about his invention (well, his team's invention).

Nos podemos dar cuenta de lo cegado que puede llegar a estar el ser humano solo por ambición (en el caso de J. Robert) y venganza, en el caso de Lewis Strauss. Mis puntos a destacar son: La actuación de cillian, rdj, y emily blunt (en sus cortos minutos de aparición) creo que supo encarnar de muy buena manera el papel de una esposa frustrada, desconsolada y entristecida con lo que pasaba en la vida de su marido. La banda sonora compuesta por Göransson, los movimientos de cámara cuando el protagonista sentía remordimiento o se iba dando cuenta de lo que hizo, las escenas grabadas (y sin CGI, al puro estilo Nolan) de las partículas, y la escena final \"creo que fue lo que hicimos\" y la del principio \"¿Puedes escuchar la música, Robert?\" fueron las que posicionan a esta obra, como una de mis favoritas de Nolan, y las que también deja a Oppenheimer como una oda al cine sensorial. En resumen: Todo en esta película está muy bien ejecutado: actuaciones, dirección, vestuario, cinematografía, diseño de producción. Todo está perfectamente combinado y funciona muy bien para meternos de lleno en esta historia."

Their films echo the works of masters such as David Lean, John Huston, Francis Ford Coppola, Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, Michelangelo Antonioni and Stanley Kubrick, to name a few. I hope Oppenheimer is the last TIK -TOK hack job we will ever see getting accolades.

A test and not actually the Hiroshima scene was showed. Turned it off after it got passed that. Overhyped, confusing and boring"
