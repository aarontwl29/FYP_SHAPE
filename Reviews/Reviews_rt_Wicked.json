Please give us more characters like Moana that are normal sized humans. Im not okay with front ribs showing on an example of a beautiful princess. Wheelchair is awesome, green is awesome, MALNOURISHED Galinda is not acceptable. Feed her to normal dimensions. I will not watch this again in front of impressionable children."

The world of Oz feels much more populated than the original film might lead you to believe. It also feels like an actual governed society instead of some outlandish fantasy world. Cynthia Erivo did a great job as Elphaba and gives a convincing performance, but Ariana Grande stole the show for me. She embodied her role so whole-heartedly; I forget that she isn't actually like that in person. Her comedy in this movie was priceless (for me, at least). It was exactly my kind of humor. I chuckled here more than any other movie this year. The story was pretty basic. It's the same old \"misunderstood villain\" schtick that I've grown tired of, but the B-Plot was very interesting. I hope that it gets elaborated upon going forward. And yes, this is only Part One. They have more story yet to tell. I found it more entertaining than I expected it to be. 4 out of 5."

Cynthia Erivo‚Äôs bone-vibrating voice is as powerful and moving on screen as it is on the stage, likely placing her in the conversation for best singing performance ever put on film. Ariana Grande‚Äôs successful musical career kept her from showcasing her acting talents for a while, but viewers of Nickelodeon during the 2010s are well aware of her brilliant comedic timing.

    "review": "I am a huge fan of the novel series by Gregory Maguire, and therefore rolled my eyes at the announcement of the movie that promised to be an adaptation of the stage everyone loved, as opposed to the darker and more sinister (and nuanced I felt) novel series. However, I did drag myself to the theater to watch it with a friend, if only to bemuse them, and despite a first watch being distracted by a horribly distracted audience experience (people were standing up and feuding over children making too much noise) upon a second watching, I did, in fact, fall in love. What neysayers are possibly missing, and perhaps don‚Äôt want, is a more grounded story. Well, read the novels, I would say to that. But for this musical, for this adaptation, and for mainly the characters of Galinda/Glinda and Elphaba, Jon M Chu successfully inserted just enough more nuance and character development to make this, honestly, superior to the stage experience. If you want the glitz and glam and stage craft, absolutely see the stage play. Short, sweet, to the point. It gets the message more or less across of ‚Äògirl discriminated against because she is different, meets people along the way, becomes bitter, and falls in love and, well the story (and my memory) gets fuzzy toward the end but whatever don‚Äôt think about it.‚Äô What the movie does is it takes that raw story, takes even more of the aesthetic of the 1939 film than Gregory Maguire, in a written medium, was able to infuse, and sets all of that ablaze with the looks that Ariana Granda and Cynthia Erivo conjure between one another and those on the periphery that inform their tale. Truly spell binding, with engaging choreography and enough detail that it warrants multiple watches, and while you are searching for each new moment, you get to once again listen to Cynthia belt ‚Äòthe wizard and I‚Äô, unknowingly joke about her tragic fate of melting, and be excited to meet the man that will ultimately cause her revolt and ultimate disappointment, and Ariana‚Äôs ability to act priveledged, but simultaneously show the truth behind Gregory Maguires character of Glinda, which is more that she never had the opportunity to think before meeting Elphaba, and though it is startling, Glinda does ultimately happily rise to the challenge. Again, magnificent and spellbinding. Thank you, John M Chu, and I‚Äôm still waiting for that stupid picnic deleted scene!"

Costuming is by-and-large great as well, albeit with a few notable flops. Sets are mostly good, but the overuse of CGI really holds a lot of scenes back. Its glaringly obvious in quite a few scenes and makes several big moments just look silly - I really wish they had used more practical effects. And the music is mostly good too, though the unnecesarry riffs from both leads do take away from it at times... But most of the issue is with the acting - apart from a couple standouts, it is just a mess. Elphaba and Glinda's dynamic should be the centerpoint of this story, but despite all their time together, they just dont sell that - every interaction between them feels forced and fake. I didnt expect them to fully live up to their brodway counterparts, but I was at least expecting them to look like they genuinely care about each other by the end... Boq also gets a strange amount of screentime for such a minor character, and is never fun to watch. While Nessa doesnt get enough to feel like a meaningful character, which will certainly hamper the second half."

There are certainly some lessons to be learned from the film, like not judging others.

When I was growing up I loved wicked it really spoke to me being bullied defying gravity was one of the things I would just listen to on repeat so when I heard wicked was becoming a movie I was overjoyed. The Cast when I first heard i was impressed but I was skeptcal at one person Ariana Grand but after watching the movie I was proven wrong. I've known Ariana Grand as a popstar for a while now so I thought they would just have her turn this movie into one of those anyoing ripoffs with references everywhere but I saw that they didn't do that and that Ariana was Hilarious and did a perfect job in popular and a perfect pick for Glinda so even though everyone else was amazing I have to say the Ariana Grand is the true wicked MVP. Cynthia Erivo I barley knew of but when I watched wicked I went back home and watched every movie she was in because she is so talented she can belt act and deliver her role as Elphaba was a perfect fit and Honestly when I heard who else was audtioning for Elphaba I was rooting for people like Lady Gaga and Lea Michelle but when I watched wicked I knew they had made the right choice. Let's just say this Johnathon Bailey you are Amazing he delivered just like I expected He was the only person I wasn't skeptical with, Dancing through life is one of my favorites and I relate to that song a lot and Johnathon Just made the song really come to life. So that is Ranking of The Wicked Movie an amazing part of entertainment history and an amazing cast"

The two principals were amazing as was Goldblum who carried off his number with style. I had never considered him a singer before seeing this but he performed marvelously. Michelle Yeoh was wonderful as was the entire supporting cast. The cinematography was spectacular and the sound recording and editing was as good as it should be for a musical presentation. I have been a fan of the Wizard of Oz since first seeing it when I was eight. The most impressive character was the Wicked Witch of the West played by Margaret Hamilton. Cynthia Erivo honored Hamilton with her portrayal of this character. The story was well designed - the writers found a way to take us back to before Dorothy while recalling the original story. A real winner that I would give a higher score to it, if I could, but I found it too operetta-like in some cases. Script was sung that would have been better left as spoken dialogue. If not for that, the movie would deserve five stars but because of that I can only give it four and a half. But, it's definitely worth the watch. Summary: A great musical."

For multiple reasons I have known Wicked since 2019, so when I heard that they were making a Wicked movie starring these 2 absolute powerhouses Cynthia and Ariana, I was so happy. Ariana wanted to be in Wicked since she was little, and Cynthia was no less than perfect to play Elphaba. Their chemistry on camera and off was so amazing they made their characters connection really come to life. The special effects, the voices, the ensemble, the acting, the feeling that you are watching a real story when its fiction, everything is amazing.

But I went into this with ideas based on what I could remember of the Wizard of Oz, and so it was hard for me to readjust my perception on who I thought was going to be \"wicked\" and who was not. And even when I it dawned on me who I was supposed to like and dislike, that too took another turn. I think in hindsight, had I been informed about what the Broadway version of this story was all about I would've been more accommodating. But putting that aside, I also found the songs to be for want of a better word \"off-key\". A lot of the notes just keep going in the wrong direction for me, and I found that I could not hum along. I like musicals that have songs that are easy to pick up and for some reason I could not do it here. So, that was enough for me to be meh about the movie. But, if I was to analyse this movie from a critical perspective I'd have to say the casting was just sublime - from the somewhat shallow, but on the very edge of breaking through into someone of substance Galinda, to the enigmatic and charming, but ultimately serving no real purpose at all Oz. And though I have no love for the songs, they were delivered with great emphasis. And the stage settings were very innovative and a delight to look at. It just bugs me that on this occasion, reading a synopsis of the Broadway Version might have made a difference for me."

Ariana Grande is a wonderful singer but barely adequate as an actor: stay in your lane, Ms Grande! Cynthia Erivo, however, is perfect for the role of Elphaba possessing both the Broadway musical singing power and the necessary acting chops to pull off this major role. Splitting this story into two parts is just a blatant attempt to milk the public for all its worth. Musicals are best for the stage and Hollywood hasn't made a decent musical movie in decades. Give us as live theater musicals and spare us for all the campy acting from Ms Grande, Bowen Yang, and most of the others, with the exception of Michelle Yeoh (who should never be asked to sing ever again)."

I get it, it has hype and everyone is supposed to love it. Maybe if you haven't seen it on stage it's spectacular. Maybe it's the same concept as \"the book is better\", but the film just doesn't have the magic. The acting is underwhelming. Ariana is the best, however it just feels like she's doing a Kristen Chenoweth impersonation the whole time. She didn't make the character her own, maybe she would have failed if she tried, so it's a bit of stacked deck either way. As far as Cynthia goes, her first song made me think \"why didn't they get a professional singer?\", then I looked her up and was shocked. She clearly has the singing pedigree so it has to be something with stage singing not translating to film, or the sound recording. There's just something off with her solos. Visually it's nothing special, CGI is average at best. Overall the film is just underwhelming. End of the day, it's fine to experience the story and music if you can't see it on stage or if live musicals aren't your thing, but the film doesn't hold a candle to a live performance. Other Broadway to films have been done successfully, this one just falls short. This is ok for a one time watch, but repeated watches would be a task, especially at 2 hour 40 minutes. (OMG it's really only part oneüò≠ I thought they were going to do like a cute intermission in this film not split it into two movies. wtf?!)"

You must bring room for laughs, love, and briefly tears when buckling in for the ride Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande take you on! The singing is superb and there couldn't have been a better way to leave us to pining for more. I will leave you with this. Wicked For Good (Part 2) releases November 21, 2025, and my family has already made plans to be there opening weekend to support this two part film that will forever be a part of our discography at home!"

Lovely cameos from ‚ÄúAdele Dazeem‚Äù and Kristin Chenoweth! But comparison side by side did not help Ariana Grande. As adorable as Ariana Grande is and clearly bent over backwards to sound right for the part, she is no Kristin Chenoweth! Unfortunately, with all my love for her, Michelle Yeoh was a total miss for me, terribly miscast, even though she did her best. Even Melissa McCarthy would have been better. Bette Midler would have nailed it. Helen Bonham Carter, Imelda Staunton, or Patti LuPone, or Bernadette Peters. So many better choices. I know, they never ask Broadway people to do film musicals. Why? No idea. Yeoh doesn‚Äôt have the right vibe of an ‚Äúold battle axe‚Äù, which is what this part is and has always been in the Broadway version! I guess they wanted a big name and an Oscar Winner. Staunton has an Oscar nomination and she is a dame, and she is actually a singer! Bette Midler has two Oscar nominations and is a singer! Why didn‚Äôt they ask any of them? But overall quite fun. Musical numbers as stand alone are great! And visually stunning, but that was expected."

Now that its free on peacock I figured, why not? And boy I was tearing up at the end. The performances from both the female leads were amazing and the songs truly make the film. Glenda was such a comic relief the whole time she was on screen. The only nitpick I have about this is that I felt... a whole lot of nothing actually happened during the film? We get background on Elphaba, she goes to school, bonds with the goat professor, frees a cub, goes to a dance, then she sees the wizard. That honestly felt so fast and slow all at once. Although I've never seen the Broadway show and I have zero clue what's supposed to happen next, I almost wish they released both movies close together or just made this an HBO special with several parts. That being said this was so well made and a treat to watch."

Hollywood has taken a great book and a clever musical and as is it's wont, managed to make worst of both! The storyline is a mangled confusion of the two, resulting in an uncomfortable mix of political fable and Musical. Yes the sets are impressive, rich, and complex, but after half an hour or so one is so overwhelmed by them and the colour saturation (presumably a reflection of the Garland film in Technicolor) that a rest in a darkened room may be advised. And the two main characters are woefully miscast. Cynthia's Elphaba is, unbelievably given she's green, unmemorable. The book describes her as an independent feisty, deeply political creature, whereas Cynthia's portrayal seems to be of a slightly wet and insecure girl. And AG's Glinda is so robotic she may as well be AI! The book describes her as charismatic, but selfish and bitchy with a sharp and witty tongue. AG is none of this. They both lack charm and screen presence and for me, despite the fact that they're the only two students not in uniform, they almost blend into the over blown background. All in all a disappointment."

    "review": "This movie fails at everything it tries to do. The runtime is simply unacceptable and the movie is filled with Hollywood bloat. Copius needless dialogue scenes added with the characters taking significantly large (7-10 second) pauses between each line so the generic Hollywood score has time to play and tell the audience what emotion they're supposed to feel. Neither Cynthia Erivo nor Ariana Grande seems willing to give their all to their characters, with Ariana's poor acting being a particularly sore spot of the movie. The aesthetic of the movie leans towards plastic, fake, and overly CGI'd, completely losing any sense of immersion. The lighting is particularly dreadful and does nothing to support the story or the emotions of the scene. (The lighting for the final scene, in particular, is very bad.) The pacing is horrid. The movie lurches from slow dialogue scene to slow dialogue scene, occasionally grinding inexplicably to a halt to begrudgingly shoehorn in one of the songs from the musical that it attempts to pay homage to. The musical numbers are so underwhelmingly choreographed and shot, with two of the biggest and most iconic numbers in the show sharing the exact same setting and color palette (their shared dorm room). All this pales in comparison to how they murdered \"Defying Gravity\", which was all I was holding out to hear after over two and a half hours of stupid Hollywood slop. They insisted on chopping the song up into sections so they could continually cut away from it, completely stop the song to switch back to the generic Hollywood score, add fake tension to a scene that didn't need it, then once again come back and remember they're supposed to be singing literally the showstopping number. It's like if Les Miserables kept stopping \"One Day More\" to show you footage from The Wire. Just terrible. This movie didn't even deserve to play the songs from the musical which it so wickedly massacred. Prior to watching this, I had thought I might at least sit through Part II to hear For Good, but now knowing how poorly they executed Part I, it's not worth my time or money. I'll just put on the OBC soundtrack."

I don‚Äôt like musicals but had to see Wicked for the culture moment. Cynthia Erivo gave me chills, and although I did not like the character of Glinda, Ariana Grande performed her very well. I went into this open to being impressed or just find it wasn‚Äôt for me, and I was so impressed. The costumes, the world of Oz, the plot, all were very absorbing. It‚Äôs easy to understand why this is such a beloved franchise."

I have no idea if it was actually an improvement from the stage show or not, but I have to say that the visual aspects were amazing, and there was no doubt that the singing would be fantastic, and it was. Ok movie but I don't think it was good enought to get 10 nominations in the Academy Awards. Sit back and enjoy."

    "review": "Cynthia Erivo, as Elphaba, did a fantastic action. She makes the character real, and her singing is so powerful. I have goosebumps and cry when hearing Defying Gravity at the movie's end. Ariana Grande, as Glinda, her character is funny, but when she sings, her emotions go with it. When Cynthia and Ariana sing together, they make it more perfect and act like real friends. Their feelings and friendship are realistic. The Original Soundtracks are way better than Disney movies these days. They are all good. I‚Äôve listened to the original musical, and I like the movie version more. I personally like Defying Gravity, which makes me emotional; Dancing Through Life and Popular is a fun song. The Wizard And I has a great high note at the end; and One Short Day, featuring Idina Menzel, Kristin Chenoweth, and the original cast from the musical version of Frozen. Wicked is a prequel to The Wizard of Oz but focuses on how Elphaba becomes The Wicked Witch of the West. The story is about Elphaba and Glinda's friendship. They met at Shiz University in the Oz. Animals can talk and teach in the university, but the plot twist is that The Wizard of Oz is not a good person. He wants those animals to be blamed so he can continue controlling Oz. Still, Elphaba knows this and resists it by stealing the grimmer, the magical spell book, and becoming The Wicked Witch to resist The Wizard. Her relationship with Glinda reaches a crossroads as they take different paths. Even though the movie is 160 minutes long, I don‚Äôt get bored at all. Every moment and every action is worth watching. The CG is excellent. I watched it in IMAX, and the sound, the songs, everything feels so real. This is the first time I've watched such a great musical movie. Part 2 will be released on November 21 this year, and I will absolutely watch it. I‚Äôve listened to the song For Good from Part 2, and its meaning really touches me. The people who said Wicked shouldn‚Äôt won the Oscar are biased and mad because their favorite movie didn‚Äôt win. Wicked deserves an Oscar, the reviews from critics and audiences are above 80%. This is one of the highest-rated movies in 2024 and the highest-rated musical movies in 2024. The whole song from Wicked debuts on the Billboard 200 charts, no other film can do this. This proves that Wicked deserves an Oscar."

Elphaba in other movies is evil only because of her sister's death. But she is considered a wicked witch. I enjoyed the movie, but the only thing I don't like is the part about the animals. The animals have to stick up for themselves and how the animals aren't going to be able to talk anymore. I also like how diverse it is. Glinda and Elphaba get better throughout the movie, but Glinda doesn't seem like a good witch. And the romance was very short; I wanted to see more romantic scenes with Elphaba and Fiyero. I wonder what's going to happen to Elphaba and her relationship with Fiyero."

In all honesty, I wasn‚Äôt even expecting Ariana Grande to be so good at this either since most I had seen from her acting was some Disney. Also, the plot is as real today as when the Broadway musical came out. A ‚Äúwizard‚Äù lying and manipulating the masses‚Ä¶ what does it sound like?

Ariana Grande also introduced herself to a new audience, as the pop princess handled the dramatic material with aplomb, holding her own with seasoned actors. So far this movie has been a box-office juggernaut yet they've been shut out this awards season, but if they don't win a couple Oscars, we'll know Hollywood doesn't appreciate excellence."

In particular, The Wizard and I, One Short Day, Defying Gravity, and Dancing Through Life surpassed all expectation. The script masterfully jumped between quippy humor, introspective dialogue, and dazzling cinematic scenes. I can confidently say that I wouldn't hesitate to watch Wicked again-- and I did. Not even a month after my initial Wickedness, I bought tickets to see the performance again. The novelty had dissipated, but the movie still held up. Again, the music amazed, the cast entertained, and the movie enchanted. Wicked is an expectation surpassing, tactile masterpiece entirely deserving of its five-star rating"

La pel√≠cula usa cr√©ditos cl√°sicos como los de la pel√≠cula original y de cierta manera toma bastante del encanto musical de esta. Al igual que con la precuela de Sam Raimi, esta pel√≠cula es visualmente bella y colorida, con un magistral dise√±o de producci√≥n y alucinantes efectos visuales. Supieron plasmar la magia de Oz con la producci√≥n y los n√∫meros musicales. Las canciones tienen el tono emocional de la pel√≠cula cl√°sica y las coreograf√≠as se sienten muy fluidas y bien elaboradas. Es indiscutible que se trata de una obra de arte cinematogr√°fica a nivel visual y hasta narrativo. Con respeto a esto √∫ltimo, hay que aclarar que tanto esta pel√≠cula como el musical de Broadway se basan en la novela Wicked: The Life And Times Of The Wicked Witch Of The West de 1995. Dicha novela act√∫a como una precuela del relato original, aunque tiene algunas diferencias con la obra de Baum. De hecho, se trata m√°s bien de una reimaginacion del relato original o una realidad alterna donde La Bruja Mala Del Oeste nunca fue la verdadera villana. Tanto esa novela como el musical y esta adaptaci√≥n usan la misma f√≥rmula de Maleficent y Dracula Untold. Siempre ha sido interesante conocer el pasado de los villanos m√°s conocidos del cine para entender sus motivaciones. Si hay algo que estas historias ense√±an es que ser malvado no es algo con lo que nacemos, sino que es la misma sociedad la que nos da esa imagen. Esto est√° muy bien representado en la pel√≠cula Joker. En esta pel√≠cula Elphaba es una chica que sufre de prejuicios debido a su apariencia, pero que posee un incre√≠ble poder. A lo largo de la pel√≠cula vemos como eso hace que se vaya forjando la imagen de bruja malvada que ha tenido en la historia que todos conocemos. Cynthia Erivo hace un maravilloso trabajo tanto en la actuaci√≥n como en el canto al darle vida a este personaje. Aunque se ha juzgado la elecci√≥n de Cynthia, fue una elecci√≥n acertada para darle credibilidad a uno de los temas fuertes de la novela que est√°n en la pel√≠cula. La novela original se caracteriza por tocar temas adultos relacionados con la discriminaci√≥n, los derechos de los animales y la corrupci√≥n pol√≠tica. Estos temas est√°n bien plasmados en la pel√≠cula y ayudan a entender las motivaciones que llevan a Elphaba a convertirse en la enemiga de Ciudad Esmeralda. La √∫nica amiga de Ephaba es Galinda, quien tiene todo ese encanto y generosidad que siempre la ha caracterizado. Hay que decir que aqu√≠ Galinda tiene esa caracter√≠stica estereot√≠pica de una dama tradicional que le da bastante encanto. Vemos que es alguien con una personalidad animada y que no se aleja de una quincea√±era hija de una familia rica. Ella es como una caricatura femenina de la d√©cada de los 30 que luce bastante elegante y radiante. Ariana Grande hace brillar a este personaje con su incre√≠ble carisma y su bella voz. Su debut en la serie Victorious demostraba que ella ten√≠a un gran futuro y en esta pel√≠cula logr√≥ demostrar de lo que era capaz. Es indiscutible que Wicked: Part 1 es una maravillosa pel√≠cula que ofrece una nueva perspectiva sobre el mundo de Oz, pero sigue manteniendo su magia. Mi calificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es un 9/10."

She does a great job being a co lead and at times over shines Cythina Erivo who has a great performance herself. But for me Grande was just amazing probably the best singer to actress conversation I have ever seen. As for the film I have not watch the musical play but this was a great way to not only get people interested in the play but in the world of Oz won't be surprise if more theater plays make the jump to the big screen. Overall, great film."

The \"Dancing Through Life\" sequence stood out to me as the best of the best dance numbers, reminiscent of the old time Busby Berkeley style of choreography. The special effects in the movie were dazzling, but not unexpectedly so. Overall, I was impressed by the music, but would have liked to have seen more of a plot. The movie could have been shorter. 2:40 makes for a long movie. By the end, I was not sorry to see it end."

    "review": "- A True Contender That Deserved the Spotlight Unlike some of this year‚Äôs baffling award favorites, Wicked was a cinematic triumph. Engaging from start to finish, it delivered everything a musical should‚Äîspectacle, heart, and unforgettable music. The performances were nothing short of perfection, elevating an already iconic score with depth and emotion. What makes Wicked stand out is how it masterfully balances its grand scale with intimate character moments, a challenge many musicals fail to meet. It was ambitious in every aspect and exceeded expectations at every turn. Frankly, I don‚Äôt understand how any other film could be considered over it this year‚Äîthis was the true cinematic achievement."

Some of the songs fell flat for me, and it probably could have been about a 1/2 hour shorter for my entertainment value. A plot line about the prejudice and targeted elimination of talking animals seemed out of place within the general tone of the story. Overall, a very well done movie. How much enjoyment you get out of it will probably depend on how much you like musicals. I'm generally \"okay\" with them, so my millage was probably a bit lower than some other people's."

Ariana Grande was a great Galinda she did the character justice. On the other hand Cynthia Erivo made Elphaba her own in a way that made the character more interesting than any Elphaba on Broadway. Jon M. Chu the director you are, you always bring musicals to life without killing their meaning and story while adapting them from the stage to the big screen. Even though the movie was 2 hours and 40 minutes, I watched it 5 times and never once got bored. The movie is a fun roller coaster to all musical and non musicals lovers."

An absolute must see weather you have been able to see it on stage or not. A few minor quibbles - there were no dwarfs/short people that could be seen for the roles of the Munchkins (why?), a somewhat forced same-sex relationship for background characters (again, why?) and lastly, Ariana Grande needs to be given a sandwich... she looked so thin and her shoulder bones, chest bones / ribs could all be seen prominently.. not a great look."

    "review": "Probably the greatest cinematic masterpiece of my lifetime. I've seen the Broadway Musical twice and was skeptical about how Hollywood would do with this, particularly with Pop Star Ariana Grande starring in it. I was awestruck with how amazing she was as was Cynthia Erivo. The sets, costumes, dancing and design were incredible. I can't think of any scene in the movie that could have been done better. I believe Defying Gravity, the final scene, was the greatest movie ending I have ever seen. Do yourself a favor and see this. I would rank this up there with Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, and Citizen Kane."

    "review": "Ehh‚Ä¶ I feel like half of this movie was really good, and the other half sucked. The production design was incredible, and the songs were very well-choreographed. The wordbuilding was great, and created a (semi) realistic look into what the world of Oz is actually like. The plotline with the animals was compelling, and the last 30 minutes were genuinely great storytelling. Everything before that, though, felt off. It felt like a generic, poorly written version of High School Musical with Harry Potter elements. It just didn‚Äôt work. But the ending was great. Hopefully Part 2 is more like that."

    "review": "Far too long, and too many scenes dragged on! Especially song and dance numbers. The main stars were outstanding: Ariane Grande was a revelation, with a fantastic voice., and added some humour; and Cynthia Erivo actually garnered empathy for her character, and showed depth in explaining how she became who she did, and I do like Jonathan Bailey, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum. Marissa Bode was really good too, and poignant as the girl confined to a wheelchair.. Loved the animals, especially the goat professor, and their subplot: the stormtroopers dragging him out from the lecture hall gave a jolt, specially given our current political reality, and the campaign for ethical treatment of animals! And I liked the Oz meets Hogwarts university town and natural setting - not so much the Emerald City, futuristic nightmare combined with an ugly, over mechanical past."

    "review": "Unbelievably over the top. Ariana Grande sings through her nose and her character appears far too often: it/she is extremely annoying. The other set pieces were chockfull (i.e far, far too busy) of people, colours and changing sets. Barely could understand what was going on, as the camera panned and swerved and passed over the many dancers. Seems to appropriate Hogwarts school for wizards, into the same wizards training school. Michelle Yeoh as the Professor is the only good thing going in these scenes. Too many eager faces trying to catch the camera, it seems. The songs were awful - all sung (by either the stars or the ensemble) to what seemed to be the same tune. The parts of the song(s) were played at very predictable scenes, with the only changes being the lyrics. If you could understand what was being sung, with appalling ups and downs in the same word. Very contemporary, with the loud background music thankfully drowning out what passed for \"singing\"."

The sets, make-up, and cinematography make for some great eye candy. Despite all of that, there are some questions to be asked. The play ran for 150 minutes. Why is the first HALF of the film franchise longer than the entire play? There‚Äôs a lot of filler that could be trimmed, but two movies are clearly twice as profitable for the studio, one would suppose. Why does pretty much the whole thing look as though it was shot in the gloom of Hogwarts instead of the colorful and vibrant Oz from The Wizard of Oz? Why are virtually all of the Munchkins taller than Glinda? Why must the movie (and the play and the book) change our view of the Wicked Witch from inherently evil to a victim of her social circumstances? And, really, why does it need ‚Äúto be continued‚Äù?"

Although, mild spoiler for the spoilers (spoilception?) there are quite a few surprises. Chu‚Äôs take on the smash Broadway adaptation of the bestselling book series is quite possibly the best cinematic adaptation of a Broadway production since Chicago (better than Les Mis, better than In the Heights, waaaaay better than Cats). Erivo and Grande are beyond perfect in the lead roles of Elphaba and Galinda (respectively), with the former carrying the lion‚Äôs share of emotional weight, but the latter stealing pretty much every second of every scene. The music is amazing, the costuming is outstanding, and yeah, they basically kept everything (and added some more). The CGI is a bit wonky at times, but the practical set pieces are legit astonishing. Overall, even folks who claim to not dig musicals, will probably (almost certainly) dig Wicked. If you do dig musicals, this is THE film to see of 2024."

    "review": "They will say that when it comes to telling stories that nothing is new. Personally, I would agree. However, to find a way to convey messages in a way that moves people after they have already heard them could be no greater achievement. I am not a critic. I love the results efforts more than I love the results for most things in life. Perhaps one day I will learn to be overly critical of products and not the process, but I doubt that life becomes enjoyable at that point. For me, a non-critic, I can only say that the work which must come from countless efforts may be uncounted but will not go unseen for this film. I did not finish it in my first sitting, but fortunately I bought it. I would say I loved it, but that would be redundant. I love everything. So, to escape from repeating myself I would only say congratulations to an almost infinite number of moments that it must have taken to produce the display of talent. A culmination of pure effort and it shows. Although the world changes, the stories that define our struggles, our triumphs and out achievements are on full musical display. I am very impressed by both the onscreen display of effort and without any understanding of what it must take in reality to produce am simply very glad that I decided to purchase the movie. Not just for the idea, not just for the story but to help them celebrate their achievement which my opinion may not matter in the long run, but their effort will inspire people for generations to come. I could not imagine the pressure one would feel striving to be considered in such a way as in the same realm of work as the Wizard of Oz. I would never engage in the argument for the works are in two different worlds and generations apart. But as far as deserving the consideration there is no doubt that the effort of all involved is apparent and deserving of praise and recognition. So, I wrote this review. I like the movie, I bought the movie, and I will watch it again. Thank you."
