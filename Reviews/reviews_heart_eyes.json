Meta/referential? Tries to be a lot without being entirely successful in some. If it tried to stick to a couple sub genres and focused on those; I think the movie would be more successful. Does pull out a pretty good half twist. Overall just a nice laid back horror movie to enjoy at home."

Even though Heart Eyes doesn‚Äôt reinvent the slasher formula, it does have lots of fun turning the rom-com formula on its head.

Especially the revealing of the killer(s) is quite underwhelming, a build up to a really surprising reveal would have made the whole thing more interesting, but You know it a while before the finale and it does not make much sense. Josh Rubin made Werevolves Within, which I like very much, I would recommend, to watch this one instead. Still Heart Eyes is entertaining enough for a nice movie night."

I love the special effects, the acting, the directing, the script and the storyline. The cinematography is shot very neatly and when we see through the POV through Heart Eyes at times it reminds me of a homage of Michael Myers from Halloween, which to me is an amazing shout out from the horror classics that came before it.

This clever and unexpected blend of slasher thrills and rom-com charm delivers a unique twist on both genres, resulting in a surprisingly fun and quirky watch. At its core, Heart Eyes plays with the conventions of both genres, combining the suspense and tension of a traditional slasher with the warmth and lightheartedness of a rom-com. The film thrives on its playful, self-aware tone, offering up moments of genuine horror alongside equally genuine (and sometimes surprisingly sweet) romantic gestures. There's something incredibly refreshing about watching a killer chase scene quickly followed by a heartfelt, awkward first date. While the film clearly doesn't take itself too seriously, the seamless integration of humor and horror is a testament to its clever writing and direction. It doesn't forget the thrills that fans of the slasher genre crave, but it also invites viewers to laugh, swoon, and even cringe at the same time. Ultimately, Heart Eyes is a surprisingly enjoyable watch. It's a movie that both slasher fans and rom-com lovers can enjoy, and one that keeps you guessing with every twist, turn, and unexpected punchline. By the time the credits roll, you'll find yourself wondering if this offbeat combination might just be the future of both genres."

Heart Eyes takes familiar tropes and themes from polar opposite genres and bashes them together to create a dark tone with a genuine heart and spirit. Unlike some lesser slashers, these characters and their relationship are given time to become something the audience cares about and wants to see overcome the evil they are faced with. The slasher villain itself, while not as memorable as its main victims, has some great creative kills and a genuinely scary design that all relate to the holiday the film is set around. Only flaws would be this is another of those modern comedies that's just not funny. But that does not distract from the pacing and excitement the rest of the film brings. Great to see something stand against My Bloody Valentine for your Valentines Day choice."

Slaughtering couples is a hallmark of slasher films, I'm surprised there haven't been more pairings of the genre with Valentine's day. This is what you get here. It's as if someone came up with the idea, and then a movie was slapped together with scotch tape. There's nothing new here, not even decent kills. Ok, maybe one decent kill at the end. The movie is intentionally cheesy, but there's just too much of it. Kinda like when you order loaded nachos because you're a fan of cheese, and then you get a plate of chips swimming in cheese. I wanted to stop watching 20 minutes into the movie, but the movie recieved praise from some of my favorite movie critics. So I forced myself to continue watching.... I no longer follow said critics. Horror fans, run! Run and do not look back! And for the love of the invisble man in the clouds, try not to trip and fall..."

      "review": "Heart Eyes has the makings of a really cool modern slasher character. The killer's design is pretty cool, and the concept of killing couples on Valentine's Day is a novel idea. The movie even starts off well with some creative kills. However, the movie goes downhill from there. It turns into an incredibly corny romcom‚Äîthe dialogue is sappy, and the characters feel cartoonish. The movie then whiplashes between romance and horror, as if suddenly remembering there's a killer on the loose. At one point, in the middle of a chase, the characters start opening up to each other‚Äîwhich was definitely not the time. Meanwhile, the killer becomes increasingly incompetent, failing to take out the main characters. The comedy doesn't land, the romance is bland, but the kills are at least enjoyable. Just don't go into this expecting a full-on slasher horror movie."

I been excited this and I jump up my seats all when Heart Eyes begin killing couples and chasing against Mason and Olivia characters since I was kid and Terrifer 3 one . It's Comedy horror type of stuffs Heart Eyes reveal it's twisted two-three people doing as Heart Eyes Killer üòç for me It's would be one person and main lady would been master mind. It's very very good movie that make me Happy. I hope they make Sequel and I hope the director cast TNA Joe Hendry as Heroic Heart Eyes take on Clover Eyes potential played by Barry Keoghan similar to Terminator 2."

      "review": "I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect when I started Heart Eyes, but I have to say‚Äîthis one really took me by surprise. It‚Äôs not every day you find a horror film that mixes romance, dystopia, and creature horror into one cohesive experience, but somehow, this movie pulls it off. It‚Äôs eerie, emotional, and, dare I say, even kind of beautiful in its own twisted way. The film takes place in a world overrun by terrifying, otherworldly creatures that hunt humans based on their emotions. Most people live in fear, suppressing their feelings to avoid detection. But then there‚Äôs Luna, a mysterious young woman who seems completely immune to the creatures. She‚Äôs fearless, expressive, and‚Äîagainst all logic‚Äîhappy. When she crosses paths with Rico, a survivor who has spent years burying his emotions just to stay alive, his world turns upside down. What really worked for me was how well the movie balanced its horror and emotional core. Sure, the monsters are horrifying‚Äîdesigned with unsettling, almost alien-like features that make every encounter nerve-wracking. But at the same time, the heart of the movie is Rico and Luna‚Äôs dynamic. Their chemistry feels natural, and watching Rico slowly break out of his self-imposed emotional prison was genuinely touching. There‚Äôs something haunting about the idea of a world where love and joy could literally get you killed, but Heart Eyes leans into that in a way that feels fresh. Visually, the film is stunning. The cinematography captures the bleakness of the post-apocalyptic world, but Luna‚Äôs presence brings an almost dreamlike contrast to it. The color palette shifts subtly as the story unfolds, mirroring Rico‚Äôs transformation. It‚Äôs one of those small details that makes the film feel more intentional and well-crafted than your average survival horror. Now, it‚Äôs not perfect. The pacing in the second act drags a little, and there are a couple of plot points that feel underdeveloped. I also wish we got a little more backstory on the creatures and how Luna‚Äôs immunity works. But at the same time, leaving some things unexplained adds to the mystery, so I didn‚Äôt mind too much. By the time the credits rolled, I realized Heart Eyes had left more of an emotional impact on me than I expected. It‚Äôs rare to find a horror film that genuinely makes you feel something beyond fear, but this one does. If you‚Äôre looking for a different kind of dystopian thriller‚Äîone that blends horror, love, and a little bit of hope‚Äîthis is definitely worth a watch."

      "review": "Heart Eyes is the kind of film that ties itself to a specific holiday with the hopes of becoming some kind of yearly tradition, in this case for couples who want to spend their Valentine‚Äôs Day constantly looking over their shoulder. Modern slasher films always seem to be trying their best to pay homage or even outright reference the classics in the genre, but do it in a way that feels and ‚Äòclever‚Äô and ‚Äòself-aware‚Äô. As a result, movies like Heart Eyes have no idea whether they want to embrace the tropes of the genre or subvert them, and instead just do whatever seems best at the time. I liked how the killing sequences were directed, with the action being exciting, visceral and, probably most importantly, comprehensible, and to top it off they‚Äôre gory without being gratuitous. The script is an aggravating collection of modern day speak, with character dialogue that sounds like it came straight out of a social media comment section, and the twists and turns are mostly ludicrous and/or blatantly signposted. There‚Äôs one they avoided that I genuinely give them credit for, since other films of this kind would jump on it without hesitation. Ultimately, Heart Eyes doesn‚Äôt represent another step in the slasher genre, and it can never really decide which tone its going for, lurching back and forth like its several different films awkwardly merged into one. But it doesn‚Äôt drag, doesn‚Äôt insult our intelligence too much and is at least willing to create characters we might actually care about. I‚Äôd prefer if they left it as a standalone, but I‚Äôm not expecting any miracles in that regard."

There were many grotesque moments of fear and violence throughout the movie, but it paired well with the notion of hopelessness that some of us have when Valentine's Day rolls around. Good movie, all in all. Don't know if I'll watch it again, but I'd recommend seeing it at least once."

But once we slice away at the first \"date\" with a good monologue by Olivia Holt which matures the movie beyond spoof comedy, things get interesting, and the movie only gets more, and more interesting, and better after that. It ended up being a whole lot of fun. Very similar to Scream in how it's structured, and its surprising use of physical comedy (lost art), but the flick uses the element of spoof comedy in a different way since it mainly makes fun of rom-coms through the lens of a horror movie. Which isn't something you see everyday. It is a love-letter to those rom-coms while making fun of it, which was fun. Thank you!"

( which btw will occur multiple times throughout the film as you would expect from a slasher.) This work has plenty of fun references to other films, like ‚ÄúHobbs and Shaw‚Äù, etc. They‚Äôve managed to create a good synergy between comedy and horror elements, which often leads to a ‚Äúcorny baloney‚Äù, however in this movie it wasn‚Äôt the case at all. All jokes were pertinent and brilliantly diluted the atmosphere and tension in the film. Moreover, I was surprised with the quality and originality of some murders. When you, horror fans, thought that you‚Äôve seen it all, believe me, Heart Eyes got something up its sleeve. The story itself whirls around two work ‚Äúnot mates‚Äù, which makes you root for them to end-up together and have the happy end, however in horror films, that‚Äôs not always the case‚Ä¶ Overall, brilliant horror film, which will make your loved ones ponder, if it‚Äôs a good idea to be a couple on Valentines Day after all. To those who love Scream franchise - this one was made for you."

In a nutshell, 2 hours of my life I‚Äôll never get back and wish I‚Äôd put towards staying at home and jumping on the PS5. Firstly, possibly the longest a movie has ever taken to get going. For what‚Äôs advertised as an 18 rated slasher movie, in-between the god-awful acting and trying to keep myself awake, I seriously almost considered getting up and walking out, until about three quarters of the way through it finally picked up. Even so, it‚Äôs a shame even the limited action/horror/slasher scenes were just as bland & cringey as the love story parts... Yuck. Secondly, plot holes, plot holes, plot holes‚Ä¶. Yes all horror movies have them, but in my opinion both the director and whoever greenlit this movie should have been the slasher‚Äôs first victim just as punishment for the sloppiness and lack of care in making the movie. Need I say more. Lastly, Jordana Brewster (Mia Toretto from Fast & Furious franchise) must be seriously desperate for cash for agreeing to be in this movie. ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs a shame even her role in the movie couldn‚Äôt save it."

This was a really fun slasher, that's also a great romantic comedy. The performances were fun, the \"will they won't they\" tension between our main leads was great. This film can easily transition from a flirty scene to an all out horror chase through the house, and it does it very well. The kills and gore were really good, and I enjoyed the gimmick and look of Heart Eyes. I will say, the 3rd act reveal (think Scream) lost me a bit with the dialogue and overdoing it. Just a little goofy in spots, but the gore came around to save it by the end. Worth watching on the big screen for a matinee or discount price."

I just love when films just have fun with their respective premises. Not every movie needs a deep message or a thought provoking metaphor to its purpose. Sometimes, just simple fun is what the viewer needs! Surprisingly, this was a lot more meta and cheesier than I originally thought it would be. There‚Äôs a lot of cheese and silliness in this film, and it doesn‚Äôt take itself seriously for the most part. Sure, the big reveal is where it kinda shifts into more serious mode, but otherwise the dialogue and atmosphere is very banter like and very easy going. You got a cast that seems to be having a blast here, and everyone is just having tons of fun as they go along the ride. I liked Holt and Gooding‚Äôs chemistry here, and they both have a funny ‚Äúenemies‚Äù to lovers dynamic here. It‚Äôs also pretty funny how they have to try convincing the killer that they are not a couple, as they‚Äôre being pursued to their doom. I‚Äôm surprised that there hasn‚Äôt been a slasher flick of this kind which involves a killer specifically only targeting couples (and that too during Valentines Day). You feel like because the vibe is so light, you‚Äôre able to take the proceedings in a lot more of a chill manner and you can just watch this for the sake of trying to see a fun and good slasher flick. Though I wouldn‚Äôt say its on the same level as a Scream or Halloween film, it‚Äôs definitely an entertaining flick which might end up garnering a cult following for the years to come. Great movie and great fun!"

Olivia Holt and Mason Gooding‚Äôs chemistry anchors the film, making their dynamic enjoyable even as the tension rises. The kills are fun and gory, hitting the right notes for slasher fans. However, the film struggles to balance its comedic moments with the chilling atmosphere. While the rom-com elements add charm early on, the humor becomes a bit too heavy later, occasionally undermining the threat and ruining some of the tension. The comedy feels out of place at times, leaving the audience unsure whether they should laugh or be on edge. The big reveal near the end, which could have been a game-changer, felt underwhelming, leaving me hoping for a more satisfying payoff. Despite these missteps, Heart Eyes remains an entertaining ride. It offers a nostalgic throwback to the early 2000s slasher era but fails to fully capitalize on its potential. Still, if you're in the mood for a fun, gory date-night flick with a bit of humor, this one is worth a watch."

As expected the movie was gory and contained plenty of creative and nasty deaths. The serial killer had a great vibe and was definiitely menacimg. Sound editing helped sell that too. There was way more comedy then I was expecting and the main actors had solid chemistry onscreen. The ending was surprisingly fresh and didn't fall too far into clich territory. There is a funny payoff with a prop introduced in the first scene too. Lastly of you're patient, there is a mid-credits stinger that wraps up things nicely."

I was baffled by many of the story choices, how terrible some of the lines were, and ultimately where everything was headed. That being said, ya know, I'm such a sucker for some brutal kills inner mixed between some great laughs. The violence is BRUTAL at times! laughed more than I should be willing to admit. Mason Gooding has such a winning charisma and love seeing him in any and everything. A horror comedy is the quickest way to my heart (lol) and Heart Eyes fits the formula. Parts of the writing team have made some of my favorite horror comedies of late but this one is probably the worst. All that said, what a fun time!"

The comedy, pace, and outrageous mix are the standout features, perfectly attuned to modern trends to keep viewers captivated.

The opening scene exemplifies this, presenting a horror opera and a mystery that intrigues and entertains. Despite some inconsistent execution, which occasionally detracts from the film‚Äôs creativity, the overall experience is enjoyable and fun. The movie delivers a series of ludicrous laughs, making it a worthwhile cinematic adventure worth seeing."

The movie has some funny moments that made me chuckle but the movie also has some great gory scenes. The Heart Eyes killer is very violent with his kills and reminds me of Jason from Friday the 13th, the way he moves and uses a machete. This definitely could be the start of a new franchise in horror. I give it a 8/10. I also see the Heart Eyes mask selling like crazy in HalloweenüòÜ"
