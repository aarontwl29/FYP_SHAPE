I can recommend to watch it once Unfortunately not great either - whole premise of young missionaries taken by an old \"heretic\" gets thrown out in second half. Film doesnt go any further than just \"look, religions copy each other\" and quickly turns into just a regular horror within a maniac house. I cant recommend it to anyone who expects a discussion about meaning of life and religion. \"It just makes us feel good\" - happy end"

Hugh Grant does a very good job playing this role that much of the film's quality depends on, and the two girls also did very nice jobs (especially Thatcher.) It's nicely shot to build suspense in the way this type of movie should, and the plot points are very well written. And though I did like how the monologues were shot, I didn't actually like many of the intellectual discussions. Because none of those clever points he made were actually that clever, it was mostly just common knowledge, I could've probably written this film. But other than that, this is a really well-made, thrilling, and very enjoyable horror film that succeeds at being a very entertaining and well-made watch."

With a star like Grant, I expected solid production values and none of the hallmarks of cheap horror: no jarring soundtrack, no wooden acting, no incoherent plot. Even the title was promising. The Heretic‚Äîwas it going to be about demons? Witches? I went in expecting originality, strong characterisation, and a good time. Instead, what I got felt like a bad Tinder date‚Äîwith a guy who‚Äôd just binged a religion podcast and couldn‚Äôt wait to share every half-baked thought it inspired. As for plot twists, scares, or any shred of originality‚Äîforget it. You‚Äôll guess the ending within the first five minutes, and the film never strays from that prediction.

The answer Mr. Reed suggests in the last scene is that everyone already knew, and there was nothing new. The movie raises questions about a real religion with sharp words, and it's no exaggeration to say that it seems to deny overall religions and faith. I think people in other countries might be more sensitive about religions. I‚Äôm wondering if the movie might cause any issues. However, for me, what Mr. Reed suggests is to the point. I don‚Äôt understand how controversial and taboo the movie is, or if the subject it explores is deep or just shallow, because I don‚Äôt have enough knowledge and experience about religions and foreign cultures. The movie has been advertised in my country as being like the ‚ÄúSaw‚Äù series. Pitiful couples."

I always hated the Hugh Grant rom-coms I was dragged to when dating many years ago, so it was a pleasant surprise to actually see him in a role in which he is designed to be hated, and he does a wonderful job of it. As many people have observed we get off to a good start, with Grant posing intellectual challenges to two raw CLDS missionary recruits. I especially enjoyed the presentations of the world‚Äôs largest religions as parallels to the history of a famous board game. (Confession: I am an atheist.) Too good to be true: it suddenly veers away from originality to clich√© after clich√© after clich√©, each one more predictable and each leaving another hole in what passes for a plot. I can‚Äôt imagine for what audience this was made: the first half is way too talky and nicely smarmy for horror/gore fans; the second half quickly alienates anyone who enjoys films which linger in their minds. (Confession: I saw \"The Brutalist\" four times in the cinema.)"

From the perspective of someone who served a mission, it feels remarkably accurate. The anxiety portrayed on screen is tangible; you can truly feel what the characters are experiencing. The religious arguments are thoughtfully crafted‚Äîenough to shake the confidence of a casual believer. The film challenges the idea of a transactional God, where prayers are expected to be answered a certain way and miracles are granted on demand. However, it falls short in portraying a deeper truth: that pure faith transcends those simplistic expectations. A testimony born of the Spirit cannot be fully grasped or unraveled through logic alone. It isn‚Äôt just a human feeling‚Äîit is divine. Incomprehensible to anyone trying to understand it by any means other than faith. Because of that, it cannot be reduced to an intellectual exercise or a philosophical argument"

Those who don't watch movies to think deeply about issues or just want a mindless sensory thriller won't like it. However this is not the film one watches to be comfortable. The film raises questions about many things people don't or can't be bothered to think about, the truth, epistemology *the nature of belief and why we beleive what we do), how strongly we believe, testing belief with practice, and power and control in belief, to name a few. This film is not just another thriller, but a philospoca; debate which will appeal to those with the courage to think deeply about life or are prepared to question their own reality/ It will leave a bitter aftertaste which will have you pondering your own belief system, and ths journey will be unnerving . The key here is in the well constructed dialogue and the sterling and chilling performance from Hugh Grant who keeps you guessing, plus very able and emtoive performances from Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East. The only shame is that this film degrades in the final seens into your more generic horror film with the usual violence and the oblifatory chase/escape scene a consession to convention and conformity, but by then the epistemological challenge has been posed."

Was als gut gemeinter austausch der Ideen √ºber Religion beginnt, wandelt sich f√ºr die beiden Damen schnell in einen Albtraum. Denn der nette Mr. Reed wirkt zwar interessiert, doch sein Ziel ist das die beiden die einzig wahre Religion begreifen. Heretic geht ca. 110 Minuten und ist ab 16 Jahren freigegeben. Wir haben hier einen Horror-Thriller mit Hugh Grant in der Hauptrolle und mein lieber Scholli begeistert mich dieser Mann. Am liebsten h√§tte ich ihm noch l√§nger zugeh√∂rt wie er mit den beiden √ºber die Religionen philosophiert und Metaphern bringt die mit Spielen, Musik oder Fast-Food zu tun haben. Die beiden Damen sind aber nicht weniger interessant, zu Beginn noch schamlos von kleinen Zicken attackiert m√ºssen sie ihren Glauben auf die Probe stellen um wieder aus dem Haus zu entkommen. Dabei gefiel mir Sophie Thatcher als Schwester Barnes besonders, denn ihre charakterliche Entwicklung ist echt g√∂ttlich. Die Spannung im Streifen ist jederzeit sp√ºrbar und man f√ºhlt wie die Schlinge immer weiter zugezogen wird. Der Sound und die dezente Musik im Hintergrund ist hervorragend. Die Motivation der Charaktere ist jederzeit sp√ºrbar. Gerade bei Hugh Grant sp√ºrt man die Leidenschaft mit der er jede Zeile mit Leben f√ºhlt, dabei kontern die beiden Damen aber auch traumhaft und man kann an diesem Duell der Worte echt Spa√ü haben. Einzig im Finale st√∂rte mich ein h√§ufiges genutztes Horror Klischee. Am Ende bleibt ein Werk das mich nahezu komplett √ºberzeugt da es hier gut geschriebene Dialoge, drei tolle Hauptfiguren und eine Story gibt die wunderbare Wendungen sowie Ideen liefert die einen in den Bann ziehen. Von mir bekommt der Film 9/10 Punkten. Wie geringsch√§tzig kann Gott sein, wenn er dir nur hilft wenn du betest?"

      "review": "Heretic is one of the latest films from A24 film studious and it‚Äôs an interesting one to say the least. Not everyone is going to enjoy it but it‚Äôs bound to have the viewer ask some questions after watching it. The movie is about 2 Mormon missionaries who visit someone‚Äôs house to go over information about their religion. The only problem is the owner of the house that they visit has other alternative motives for them. The owner of the house is played by Hugh Grant who really gives a wonderful creepy performance here. The movie is more of a psychological thriller rather then a straight horror film, even though there are moments of horror. The film keeps the viewer questioning things and on the edge of their seats throughout. My only problem is the movie doesn‚Äôt quite fully wrap up everything at the end and rather leaves the viewer with using their imagination of why everything transpired like it did. Heretic is stil worth a watch and possibly repeat viewings. Heretic gets a high 4 stars out of 5 from me."

      "review": "Heretic raises a lot of questions not necessarily about individual religions, but rather how we as people think about and view it as a whole by means of control. Many people consider seeing the quickest way to get someone to believe something, but have we ever considered feeling a way of believing? If something makes us feel what is considered to be 'the correct way' then does that make it true? Or even if we are told something is true does that make believing it any easier? Belief and trust run hand in hand. A lot of these questions arose while watching Heretic. We as human beings with limited knowledge about all of this are always trying to find which answers are the correct ones and discover that one true religion to which the idea of different iterations is brought into the conversation and the fact that, according to the movie, all religions are trying to get across the same message just in a multitude of different ways. Religion is compared to the game Monopoly to further the discussion of iterations but I also feel the comparison is made in order to show that each religion is ultimately just like one big game of monopoly. The phrase mentioned by Mr. Reed \"the more we know, the less we know\" calls upon the idea that if we end up searching too deeply then that only leads to more questions, some of which are not always answerable, so sometimes it is better to leave well enough alone."

It somehow manages to combine a serial killer thriller, a mystery, and a philosophical and religious debate into one unified whole. Two young Mormon women knock on the wrong door to proselytize. Unlike cliche horror victims, these characters begin to quickly suspect something is awry and make reasonable attempts to make an exit until the host‚Äôs intentions become unmistakable. Hugh Grant is masterful as the villain, making the most of the polite British host with gradually emerging sinister undertones boiling below the surface. There is plenty of gore and violence, but always serving the story and never with a descent into torture porn. The master plan of the evil host does seem a bit vague and muddled in the end, but this doesn‚Äôt distract from the power of the conclusion, which also manages to escape cliche."

The first half is almost entirely cerebral - but no less chilling for it - as they three play out a discussion about matters of faith and rationalism. As the reality of the situation unfolds, it becomes more conventionally horrific - but though there are shocks and there is gore, the emphasis here is on dialogue and psychological manipulation throughout. Hugh Grant is terrific, having a great time in a thoroughly nasty role; it's his work on much of the weight of this film is carried. There's also something refreshing about a horror film in which a rationalistic atheist is the villain trying to exploit and torture the people of religious faith. It's not perfect, but it's a very enjoyable, well-directed and written horror thriller in which the usual polarities are neatly flipped."

I saw it called in a couple of different places a Thriller/Mystery and a Thriller/Horror. I think it was all of those. Very smart movie, the dialogue was amazing. I think maybe the people that gave it bad reviews just couldn't keep up with the smartness of the dialogue. Hugh Grant was so excellent at sounding like a proper gentleman that these girls would trust, even if things were a little bit off. I thought the timing and suspense was great also, the suspense just built up over time and leaves you wondering what the heck is going on. I loved the young actresses performances also, absolutely believable. I would love to see Hugh Grant in more movies like this. This is a must watch."

Two wholesome but beautiful and fragile Mormon missionaries enter the house of an avuncular professor type gentleman (and Hugh Grant fits this to the tee). The conversation felt genuine and hit me hard. I once was like those two missionaries, full of idealism, and now older and jaded I found myself identifying with the antagonist's arguments...except the film takes you for a spin and did not let go. I agree with another reviewer that the payoff is questionable, but the conversations and the lead up are definitely worth the price of admission."

The acting overall is quite good with Grant leading the way, but why is Topher Grace even in this movie? A part so small it's basically unnecessary. Like the commercial where the kids run into the garage of chainsaws where the bad guy is, this movie is a huge cliche. All of it is wrapped in religiosity questions to give it a solid cult like feel which has also been done a thousand times. If this feels original to anyone then they are younger than 30 and have never seen movies like The Exorcist or The Omen and the many, many sequels, prequels, and knockoffs that followed. Don't believe the hype on this one."

Still great, but a rather uneven finish kept it from being transcendent."

They continue to go door to door in their practices and while this film held no truth in its content, it would be enough to elicit alarm at those continued practices being carried out in this day and age. Hugh Grant played the lead role well. He was very friendly, disarming and an unassuming evil character until the direction of the story begins to shift, as do his character's traits."

This film is about as disturbing as it gets. He is compelling every second he is on screen, The young women who star are terrific.

Hugh Grant is an utter delight, the teens largely up to the task, and the dialogue is often great, with some solid opening salvos regarding faith and disbelief. At the same time, I was disappointed that Grant‚Äôs Mr. Reed never responds to Sister Barnes‚Äô initial intellectual rebuttal other than revealing his crazy. Narcissistic psychosis makes for a great underpinning, but the genre tropes often overwhelmed potential subtleties that might‚Äôve proved interesting. Granted these things must always peak with survival/death, but the way the final scene tries to have it both ways feels more like an abdication that a statement regarding the themes it purports to explore. Likewise, the details of the final scene are muddied by poor editing, making it tough to understand certain decisions when it comes to the manner of fleeing. Overall, though, good stuff."

By the time the true premise of the movie is revealed, we feel the stakes first-hand, just like the characters. The film is a dark commentary on our many religions and the fear that drives us to practice them. Ultimately, Heretic is a battle for control ‚Äî between the girls and Hugh Grant‚Äôs Mr. Reed, between the girls themselves, between the characters and their Gods, between the viewer and the characters. We, as viewers, grasp at straws for any semblance of understanding or control in the twisted maze of the film (just as we do in life). We understand only as much as the filmmakers want us to at any given moment. The movie forces us to confront our own mortality, makes us wonder what we might do in a similar situation. With an eerie performance from Hugh Grant and a soundtrack that feels both biblical and hell-ish (thank you, Sophie Thatcher‚Äôs version of Knocking On Heaven‚Äôs Door), Heretic sets itself up to be an all-time great, as far as horror/thrillers go."

      "review": "Heretic is a well-crafted, original film that tackles thought-provoking themes through stellar performances, especially by an unlikely Hugh Grant, whose charmingly formidable villain is a diabolical adversary. Although it plays into horror tropes, the film is more of a psychological thriller as its primary tool for racing hearts is rising tensions and atmospherics. Nevertheless, it's plenty to keep viewers glued to the edge of their seats for its entire duration. The movie is also unique in its ability to be a philosophical debate on theology without offending any religion or belief. It shows that a good writer can tackle any topic tactfully and respectfully without risking the story's integrity."

Would definitely recommend for a very good phycological horror with very, very complicated deeper meanings and messages."

I don‚Äôt recall ever seeing Hugh Grant in a role like this before. It was nice to see him get a chance to pursue a different kind of character (unless I‚Äôve missed something he‚Äôs done). I watched the movie because I recently saw Sophie Thatcher in Companion. She is a promising young actress and I‚Äôm looking forward to her next project.

It's dialogue heavy but the dialogue is just spectacular- intriguing, interesting, thought provoking. I think I came into it thinking it's going to be a horror movie but it's more a psychological chiller. The characters are great, Hugh Grant's is just naughtily delicious. I don't want to say more as I don't want to give any spoilers. Needless to say the direction is fantastic, music is ace, scenery is superb. The whole thing is an absolute triumph.

      "review": "Hugh Grant's latest venture into darker territory starts with promise but ultimately descends into conventional horror tropes, squandering its thought-provoking premise about faith and control. The film opens strongly, with Grant delivering a masterfully nuanced performance as Mr. Reed, a seemingly cordial host who invites two young Mormon missionaries into his home. Grant's ability to balance charm with underlying menace makes the setup entirely believable ‚Äì we understand why these young women would accept his invitation despite their likely training to be cautious. The film's early moments hint at an intellectual exploration of religious belief, control, and manipulation. However, these philosophical threads are frustratingly superficial. Reed's initial arguments about the nature of faith and the relationships between different religions barely scratch the surface of what could have been a fascinating theological debate. Instead of developing these themes, the film pivots sharply into familiar horror territory. As the story progresses, Reed's character transformation proves particularly disappointing. He begins as a calculating and intelligent antagonist whose motivations, while disturbing, seem to stem from a coherent ‚Äì if twisted ‚Äì worldview about religion and control. However, this promising characterization gradually dissolves as he devolves into a more conventional horror movie villain, his actions becoming increasingly erratic and his underlying philosophy lost in favor of shock value. The film's second half relies heavily on the kind of elaborate traps and psychological games that have become standard fare in post-\"Saw\" horror. While competently executed, these sequences feel derivative and fail to advance the movie's more interesting ideas about faith, manipulation, and the human need for belief. The revelation about Reed's ultimate conclusion ‚Äì that the desire to control others is the root of all religions ‚Äì comes too late and feels disconnected from the preceding events. The movie's attempts to maintain ambiguity about the supernatural through the fake prophet sequence and the final butterfly scene feel more like narrative sleight-of-hand than meaningful commentary on faith and skepticism. These elements, while potentially intriguing, never quite cohere into a satisfying whole. What we're left with is a film that starts with the ingredients for a compelling examination of religion and control but opts instead for a more conventional path. While Grant's performance in the early scenes shows what might have been, the movie ultimately fails to capitalize on its potential, settling for familiar horror beats instead of the more challenging exploration it initially promises."

For THIS movie, though ... there had to be so many basic elements laid deftly so that the audience could understand both the mormon aspect coined with the very visceral \"cornered\" aspect of the sister missionaries ... had the action come too swiftly confusion would have ensued. This movie did a lot of admirable things. It frankly honored the religion. I no longer adhere to the Mormon faith, but I spent so many years in it that I can see the good and the bad. \"Heretic\" was amazing in that aspect. It reflected the age of the sister missionaries, and their innocence juxtaposed with their intelligence. Very hard to do. Hugh Grant. Oh. My. Gosh. The man is a genius when it comes to playing a comical bad character. Couldn't have been more perfect. But I keep coming back to the missionaries. They played their characterizations BEAUTIFULLY. Grace and intelligence. It would have been so easy to have made the sister missionaries into caricatures, but the writers resisted that urge. These two actors did an amazing job. I have \"served\" with women missionaries just like this -- because they are slightly older than the male missionaries, they are more mature and tend to be some of the most intellectual members of the religion. A classic movie. I am not a horror movie fan, so I didn't enjoy the gore. But the slimy aspects of the film were outshined by the highly skilled storyline that quite frankly honored some aspects of Mormonism. I have read that the directors not only used two ex-mormons as the stars, but also talked with friends with mormon backgrounds who provided the meatier parts of the dialogue. This definitely added to the heft of the subject matter."

Even if for half of the movie or more, it's just 3 people in a room, talking, the conversation is tense and interesting enough to keep you engaged. But then, the third act roles out... it looked like i was watching 2 different movies, and the writers had ran out of ideas; it just turned into the generic horror/thriller. Hugh Grant's performance was really, really good tho. It was very creepy and filled with all sorts of menacing tension, because he wasn't your typical agressive villain. The fact that he is so polite and articulate all the way through (his accent also helps here), it makes him that much more intimidating, because you know something about him is evil, but you never know how he will display that. All in all, i still enjoyed it. That third act was the opportunity for them to really make a statement, and sadly, they did try, but failed, in my opinion. I still recommend it. It is not a bad movie at all. It was well done enough. Maybe i should have not watched reviews for it, before watching it myself."

The film‚Äôs premise hooks you from the start: a charismatic but deeply sinister antagonist weaves a web of intellectual curiosity and fear. Grant delivers an electrifying performance, oozing charm and malice in equal measure. The movie builds tension expertly, layering mystery and horror as it exposes the characters' vulnerabilities. Each twist keeps you guessing, while the chilling atmosphere lingers long after the credits roll. Yet, for all its brilliance, the final act falters under its own ambition. The sight of six young girls locked in cages raises more questions than answers, leaving viewers scratching their heads about how the villain was able to captivate so many women without the community being alarmed. How could he move bodies so fast? These are minor missteps in an otherwise captivating narrative that is as intellectually stimulating as it is frightening. If you're looking for a film that thrills and teaches (religion and board games!) in equal measure, this one is a must-watch. Just prepare for a few loose ends in an otherwise tightly-woven tale. Rating: 8/10 ‚Äì A dark, daring journey into the abyss of human greed and faith, led by a villain you‚Äôll love to hate."

It goes deeper than just flesh spilling out after you open some door. The main point of this movie is not to scare us, but to question if we really believe?. Religion is a core part of horror movies; it always has been, but it's typically employed to depict something wicked and ominous. Unlike those movies, I personally think that Heretic used religion in a sadistic but better manner. I know Hugh Grant from playing in romantic comedies or period dramas. I believe I saw nearly all of his films when I was ten years old, because my mom is a huge fan of him. Seeing Hugh in a horror movie was truly refreshing, and the thing that affected me the most is what a great job he did. He made the long monologues seem not so long and engaging. Most importantly, he creeped me out so bad. His facial expressions and manipulative behavior truly did the job, and he delivered an impeccable performance.

Mr Reed is just seeking answers when it comes to faith trying to decide what the one true religion is. This film has all of the elements for a terrifying experience. A creepy old house, a thunderstorm, and that feeling something isn't quite right. Hugh Grant lately has been dipping his toes in the world of being a villain and less being a love interest. All i can say is Bravo Mr Grant as his performance is incredible. Charming, yet frightening at a moments notice. But Sophie's and Chloe's performance rise to the occasion as well.

Watching his character devolve further and further into pure unadulterated evil is fascinating and horrifying.

Initially, it is important to acknowledge that Hugh Grant has featured in a range of roles outside of romantic comedies prior to taking on one of the leading roles in this horror film. It was refreshing to witness his departure from his typical romantic comedy persona; in fact, I believe this performance may rank among his best. The two lead actresses also delivered commendable performances that significantly contributed to the film's impact. This film left a lasting impression on me, provoking deep thought that I prefer not to disclose in order to avoid spoiling the experience for potential viewers. As a dedicated fan of the horror genre, I can confidently assert that this film is among my top five horror films of 2024. Its intriguing narrative not only challenged my expectations but also exhibited a uniqueness that is often lacking in contemporary horror cinema‚Äîeschewing predictability and presenting a storyline that feels refreshingly original."

The script desperately tries to appear intelligent, line after line, but instead proves the exact opposite. Its endless monologues feel like an exercise in self-indulgence rather than storytelling. And the glowing reviews? It‚Äôs hard not to see this as yet another example of A24‚Äôs strategy: pandering to critics with shallow philosophy and artsy aesthetics while pretending it‚Äôs groundbreaking. Critics acting like this film is tackling ‚Äúnew‚Äù ideas only reinforce how much fluff gets mistaken for genius.

I always love a good philosophical discussion, and while the dialogue may have gotten a bit long-winded (don't we all?), it seemed like it was written by a university-level professor of theology. However, as the film progressed, it only got messier and more aimless. This seems to be a common pattern among horror movies, especially nowadays, but I was disappointed because this one had such a strong, original start.

Aside from the creepy home he lives in, it's chock full of secrets. Very seldom does a film leave me philosophizing.

The film itself is a cat and mouse game of wills, a battle of opposing beliefs, dissecting the past and trying to find the truth, if it even exists, in stories passed down through the generations. What‚Äôs so great about the debate at is its centre is its far from one sided. Its not focused on religious bashing, nor on proselytising. Both sides are given the chance to put forward their case, and you start to realise that neither is strictly right about what they‚Äôre saying, as any truth we present is inevitably tinged by our own experiences and points of view. With very few locations and only a handful of actors, its a testament to the power of a great script and talented performers. The 2 Mormon missionaries are not presented as carbon copies of each other but as 2 completely different people who simply share the same core beliefs. It‚Äôs refreshing to see a horror film where events aren‚Äôt propelled through character stupidity. Here the protagonists make relatively smart decisions, but the villain just happens to be one step ahead of them whenever they do. It‚Äôs creepy, tense, atmospheric, and brings up enough question and quandaries that inspire conversation on both sides of the argument. And that, after all, is what truly great films do."

The problem I have with this work is perhaps a bit more personal, since I am an Agnostic Atheist and see how the main character who appears to be a great wise religious critic becomes blurred and falls into his own entanglements, well, the great illusion The fact that this film becomes an intellectual exercise falls and ends in what I suppose must be a normal horror film, fear, murders and the like. However, it is a good film, although it is not too scary - at least not to a regular horror viewer - it does its job of maintaining some suspense and fear, and this with: - Idea 8/10 I haven't seen a movie with this same plot before. - Story 8/10 Well done, although I feel that in the end it is a little wasted. - Screenplay 8/10 Very good script, it has very interesting and thoughtful dialogues, although in the end I think they could have based the film more on these and not fallen so much into the nonsense of this genre, that is when the script decreases to give way to nonsense. - Characters 9/10 Basically there are 3 of them, almost with almost the same importance and they do it excellently well, you can see the difference in personalities between them without an unpleasant or forced rivalry arising to stand out, they play their role very well and manage to give them somewhat unexpected turns. - Effects 9/10 The setting is perfect, good quality without falling into exaggerations, beyond that the visual and auditory effects are what is necessary and no more. - Entertaining 8/10 You should enjoy the dialogues or perhaps be attracted by the religious theme, either of the 2 options will hook you, now if your thing is only blood, ghosts and arms for a while, it may not be the best option for you, although we have a little of everything, I think that the strong part of this work is its setting, staging, dialogues and idea.

Oddly, he chooses to inject the role with a touch of comedy (eg the Jar Jar Binks impression) and that weirdly undercut some of the gravity of the situation. They never properly explained his motivation for this elaborate, complex, and cruel system that he's devised, let alone why he's catching and keeping a small army of emaciated, lookalike women in his basement, purely in the hope of, one day, being able to deploy two of those women in this strange plot. And while the trailer implied, by showing the wooden model of the house he devised, that the two missionaries would have to go through this elaborate set of tests and tricks throughout the home, we barely ever left that single, poorly lit chamber. And this is after the world's longest and most tedious monologue from Hugh Grant. Snoozy. If there is a God, I can guarantee they're not a fan of this one."

It starts promisingly with some tension, but felt a bit silly by the end, devolving into a bit of horror schlock."

      "review": "Loved it. Sucked me in from the first frame. Cinematography, writing, performances, and set design are all excellent. I might be reading into this too much, but I think the whole point of this movie is that what religion you are or not doesn‚Äôt matter. What really matters is humanity and energy while we are here. Let me explain. At the beginning of the film, Sister Paxton hints at the fact that although Mormon, she believes in reincarnation and wants to return as a butterfly who lands on the hands of her loved ones. Towards the end, she also admits to knowing (through the great prayer experiment) that prayer doesn‚Äôt work, but it‚Äôs beautiful that we do it for each other anyway. And ultimately when she escapes, she sees the butterfly on her finger as a symbol that during our brief time here, what we do makes a difference to others, even if we are here only a brief while, and to be returned or recycled. The question is: does this make her a ‚Äúheretic?‚Äù She has ‚Äúchosen Burger King‚Äù as her fast food chain knowing it could be ‚Äúsketch,‚Äù but she‚Äôs a kind human being, and that is all ever matters in the end. The movie is a brilliant testament to humanity."

      "review": "Hugh Grant delivers a surprising and captivating performance as Mr. Reed in this psychological thriller. His portrayal of a psychopath is both chilling and compelling‚ÄîI never realized how well he could handle such a dark role until now. Grant fully embodies the character, making it easy to get pulled into the layers of Mr. Reed's complex personality. The film challenges viewers to wrestle with moral gray areas, thanks in large part to his character's persuasive arguments that almost make you empathize with him. Alongside Grant are two fantastic leading actresses who really stand out. I wasn‚Äôt familiar with their work before, but they made a strong impression here. Together with Grant, their performances create a tense and engaging story that keeps you hooked. The first two acts are brilliantly paced, gradually peeling back the layers of the plot and characters. However, the final act feels a little rushed and leaves some questions unanswered. For instance, it‚Äôs unclear whether the last sister was meant to become one of Mr. Reed‚Äôs prisoners or if their encounter was a coincidence. The ambiguous ending leaves much open to interpretation. In the climax, a dramatic confrontation leads to a stabbing, bloodshed, and a tense chase through the house. As the final sister escapes into the snow, a butterfly lands on her finger in a symbolic moment that‚Äôs up for debate‚Äîdoes it represent hope or something more ominous, like a transition to the afterlife? Overall, the film is packed with twists, suspense, and thought-provoking moments. It‚Äôs a thrilling ride with just the right mix of psychological tension and gore. If you‚Äôre a fan of gripping thrillers or love exploring complex characters, this one‚Äôs worth watching."

Instead of the crazy, big ending, This could have been far more interesting if the Hugh Grant character actually ended up to just be psychologically torturing these door knocking Mormons with basic logic, and destroying the religious fantasy foundation they built their lives on. It could have been the simple revenge tale we all wish we could enact when one of these jack ass randomly rings our door bell at 9 AM, on a Tuesday. Instead we got just another boiler plate serial killer rehash tale."

      "review": "Heretic isn't just a movie; it's a confrontation with your belief system. Unlike films that rely on twists or misdirection, Heretic builds its story on a foundation of carefully constructed facts and logic, delivering them in a way that feels both fresh and profound. Heretic isn't just a movie; it's a confrontation with your belief system. Unlike films that rely on twists or misdirection, Heretic builds its story on a foundation of carefully constructed facts and logic, delivering them in a solid framework.. Rather than steering the audience toward a predetermined conclusion, Heretic invites introspection, swirling around your thoughts and leaving you to chart your own path through its complex ideas. The director's innovative use of sensory details elevates the experience. As the camera moves, the audio seamlessly shifts to match the perspective, pulling viewers deeper into the story. This clever interplay of sound and visuals creates a suspenseful atmosphere that grips you from start to finish. As the frames alternate between symmetrical wide shots, evoking isolation, and intense close-ups that capture the raw emotions of its characters. These frames amplify the suffocating tension, making the atmosphere feel even more than hefty. This blend makes every nuanced struggle feel more intensly personal. The movie maintained a carefully thought-out environment, with attention to detail in what was placed where-from a table, or a switchboard to a Japanese water-collecting bamboo. Even when not directly in focus, these elements influenced the scenes through audio cues. For instance, music would pause at key moments, or the bamboo, after collecting and releasing water, would produce a wooden knock every few minutes. The integration of pop culture references within the religious themes added depth and engagement, from drawing parallels between Jar-Jar Binks in Star Wars and a god-like figure to using real-world examples of plagiarism and comparing religious texts to games like Monopoly, the film offered a unique lens for exploration. Hugh Grant creates an intense atmosphere in his scenes, portraying the fragile Mr. Reed, who is calm and reasonable in his actions. His subtlety holds a tight grip on the viewer, as the distance between reality and fiction is clear, yet his portrayal of the character's thought process makes the audience feel as though they are sitting in a suffocating atmosphere. The actors, together, successfully portray a struggle focused on belief systems rather than merely a fight for survival. The fusion of sound and visuals created a tight atmosphere unlike anything I've experienced before. The story itself is an exploration of faith, guilt, and redemption, packaged in a way that feels deeply personal yet universally resonant. Sum up - Walking out of the theater, I couldn't stop reflecting on the themes and emotions it evoked. Heretic isn't just a film, it's an experience that stays with you, reshaping how you view cinema and storytelling. I feel incredibly grateful to have witnessed this masterpiece on the big screen and can't wait for everyone to experience it as well!"
