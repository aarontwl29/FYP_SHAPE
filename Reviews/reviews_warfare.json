Watching this made me only think about how our armed forces deal with situations like these and function as normal humans after they enter civilian life. You can totally understand where PTSD originates from. The acting is great, it is gut wrenching and I had to hold myself back from tears. It just brought that out in me, even though it is not a tearjerker in any way or form. Great filmmaking about what it is like to be on the edge of a life or death situation at any second."

Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza have masterfully directed this film, building tension frame by frame. The suspense feels natural and grounded, while the depiction of gore and violence captures the brutal realism of combat more authentically than most films dare to show. By the one-hour mark, you're fully immersed — right there on the battlefield alongside the American soldiers, trying to make sense of the chaos and the instinct to survive. Will Poulter and Cosmo Jarvis deliver exceptional performances, breathing life into their characters with raw intensity. Overall, this is a must-watch for fans of the war genre — and an outstanding film by any standard"

They wanted to know if it would 'bring me back' to combat, as if I didn't realize there's a difference between a movie and the real thing. This movie did. This, for me, was a very realistic portrayal of a day in the life. I had tears in my eyes in that theater. For all of you \"Patriots,\" and people who wish to thank military members for their service, you owe it to yourself to get a very small glimpse of what you're thanking them for. Don't expect a Hollywood happy ending in where a soldier's to be rejoined back home with loved ones. The Hurt Locker kind of reminded me of this. The war isn't over just because you've won/lost the battle."

I think what makes the movie great is the phenomenal sound design and the grounded, realistic representation of war. There is no glorification of the soldiers or the war — it is dirty, frightening, and downright horrific. Most of the story revolves entirely around one house, as tension mounts throughout the film. The only problem is that there is no real understanding or exploration of any of the characters. However, I think that's fine, because the film is more about the horror of war than anything else."

I bought this movie for $20 when it became available at home and I really wanted to like it. American Sniper, Lone Survivor, Blackhawk Down, so many amazing war movies. This one simply had no point. It was as if they took one incident where a soldier got seriously injured and tried to make it the story of the century. At one point, they tried to minimize one soldier's injuries for another, and then made that lesser injured soldier look like he was just looking to get morphine. Another scene a guy fell in battle and you think, \"was he hit, is he mentally messed up...\" only to have him say \"I tripped\" when his partner asked if he was hit. Overall, you are left with an anticlimactic feeling like the storyline was weak. Soldiers hold up in a home, they are under fire, a few get injured, they evacuate the house...the end. Isn't that every soldier's battle story. Brave men and they deserve our eternal respect, but this wasn't movie material."

      "review": "This movie was almost good. But almost doesn't count except in hand grenades, horse shoes, and nuclear weapons. First off let me pre-face this review by saying that some of the things I think sucked and were stupid very well may have happened IRL, and may have just been military/government logic at it's finest, as opposed to the filmmakers being idiots. But I kind of doubt it. I do an also want to start with the positives. The costumes were decent, the acting was decent, the trailer looked awesome, and there was 1 brief scene were 2 SEALs were on a roof top exchanging fire with some bad guys where it looked like they actually knew what they were doing. But there's just a few things that killed all of that for me though. First off, these guys are supposedly Navy SEALs, yet in the movie they were portrayed as a bunch of awkward amateurs. Forgetting where they put their equipment repeatedly, getting shell shocked and flabbergasted anytime anything happens, messing up simple tasks. Not what I've been lead to believe SEALs are like from all the documentaries I've watched about them. Next, when it starts hitting the fan, two of their own are injured and the filmmakers spent what felt like 20 minutes focusing on nothing but these 2 injured individuals screaming, and their teammates not having a clue what to do to help them (again, SEALs?). Next up, after an IED attack out on the street, 3 SEALs go to retrieve some \"gear\" they left behind on said street. Presumably so that the bad guys don't get their \"gear\"? The 3 SEALs go out into the street shooting and covering each other to retrieve the gear in question. Which is a sledgehammer. Really? 3 SEALs risked their lives under heavy fire to run out into the street and grab a hammer? Not a grenade launcher, rifle, or bag of C4, but a hammer? Then, a few minutes later 2 Bradleys roll up to extract them in the exact spot the sledgehammer was laying, the SEALS all pour out and set up a perimeter around the Bradleys while the others load the wounded. Firstly, couldn't they have just grabbed the \"gear\" then? Second, the Bradleys, which are taking lots of small arms fire from all directions, don't shoot back. The SEALs are shooting, but not the Bradleys. Again, could be some military protocol I'm unaware of? Not allowed to shoot at infantry with a Bradley gun? But in a minute you'll see that go out the window. They load up the wounded, and some of the SEALs also get in the Bradleys. The Bradleys then leave, and the rest of the SEALs go back in the house. Where they continue to freak out and act confused. The bad guys are on the roof, so they call for the Bradleys to shoot the top floor of the house. The Bradleys come screeching around the corner and start shooting the roof. But wait, are these the same Bradleys that were just there? If so... why did they leave, drive a way, but then.... came back? And this time shooting. Or are these a second set of Bradleys? Nothing was said in the movie at all about a second set of Bradleys, making it look as though the same Bradleys that showed up a minute ago just went for a joy ride around the block with the wounded, then came back to exfil the rest of the SEALs which would've been done the first time. The Bradleys light up the roof, as well as all the other buildings around. And somehow they don't show a single bad guy getting hit, in fact, I realized I don't think they showed a single bad guy get hit the entire movie? A fair bit of shooting occurred on part of the SEALs and Bradleys (finally), but they didn't show a single enemy casualty. Hmm. A fighter jet does a super low fly-by for a \"show of force\" that kicks up a metric crap ton of dust into the air, the guys run out into the street to finally pile into the Bradleys to get away and 99% of the dust is instantly gone. They get in the Bradleys, the door shuts, and it's end of movie. I was psyched for this movie. But it left me feeling embarrassed for whoever made it, or worse if that's how these guys actually handled themselves in this situation, for them (but I doubt it). It was almost good. But wasn't."

I’m actually a big fan of some war movies going back to Big Red Ome (one of the first I saw as a kid) but this seemed to be much more about a specific 2 hours of time at war so there’s no real character development or plot. It’s a scenario designed to show people how horrible war can be. (Was it a war? Americans kept being told it was a “conflict.”) Strange to literally watch this while having a president who is defunding veterans programs left and right and laying off/firing VA workers and peeling back benefits for America’s heroes. Almost surreal that so many of them still support a draft dodger while he actively mocks them and works to defund those services that are in place to help them."

      "review": "Warfare, directed by Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza, is a visceral masterpiece that redefines the war film genre with its unflinching commitment to realism. Set during a 2006 Navy SEAL mission in Ramadi, Iraq, the film immerses viewers in the chaos of combat, drawing solely from the memories of Mendoza, a former SEAL, and his comrades. This raw, documentary-like approach strips away Hollywood clichés—no heroic speeches, no contrived drama—just the stark, unrelenting reality of war. The film’s technical prowess is staggering. Glenn Freemantle’s sound design is a character in itself, capturing the cacophony of gunfire, radio chatter, and deafening explosions with bone-rattling precision. David J. Thompson’s cinematography, with its claustrophobic close-ups and fluid handheld shots, plunges audiences into the heart of the battle, making every moment feel immediate and suffocating. The real-time narrative, unfolding over 95 minutes, mirrors the soldiers’ disorientation and dread, while graphic depictions of wounds and casualties refuse to sanitize the carnage. The ensemble cast, including Will Poulter, Joseph Quinn, and D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai as Mendoza’s stand-in, delivers understated yet powerful performances, embodying the camaraderie and fear of young soldiers without romanticizing their roles. By focusing on the American perspective while subtly highlighting the plight of Iraqi civilians, Warfare avoids jingoism, letting the futility of conflict speak for itself. This is not entertainment—it’s a harrowing, unforgettable experience that honors the soldier’s reality and challenges viewers to confront war’s brutal truth."

There is not much in the way of thrilling combat re-enactment what so ever. It was pretty much just one guy screaming in pain while the inept Americans get totally shredded by insurgents. But at last the USA shows up with high tech weapons and obliterate the insurgents, but not really either. They pretty much turn and run away all the while keeping innocent villagers held hostage , So if you are the type of person who likes to experience extreme gore, and non stop screams of agony then you would probably enjoy this. Not sure why at the end a picture of the actual group all have their middle fingers out. I think they were the ones who got F’ed. I also am a little scared that so many people out there rank a movie like this so highly."

As a veteran who served overseas, I can say with full confidence that Warfare is in a league of its own. This isn’t just another war movie, it’s a full-throttle, boots-on-the-ground experience that captures the reality of the Global War on Terror with unmatched intensity and precision. The cinematography is raw and immersive, the sound design punches with every round fired, and the attention to detail is impeccable. From tactics and comms to the emotional toll and split-second decisions, Warfare nails it. What sets this film apart is its focus on the elite Navy SEALs, the frogmen, and what they endured in silence and shadow. The pacing is relentless. From the moment the first shots are fired, you’re locked in. No fluff. Just pure, unfiltered warfare. This is as close as it gets to the real thing without being there. A masterpiece for veterans, patriots, and anyone who wants to understand what sacrifice and brotherhood truly look like on the battlefield."

For the same reason the constant crying in pain from one of the soldiers got annoying quickly. Harsh.. maybe.. but jees. To add insult to injury the Navy Seals they were depicting came across as pretty useless. Maybe the director was trying to get a more human depiction rather than that of the polished fighting machine you would expect from the highly trained and respected Navy Seals.

However, it lacks narrative depth, character development, and a structure that goes beyond mere immersion in a single moment.

This Chinese knockoff attempts to honor battlefield heroism but ends up feeling like a military-themed group project where no one read the assignment. Let’s start with the positives: the cinematography is surprisingly solid. Explosions are crisp, drones glide like Michael Bay interns had a few Red Bulls, and there’s enough shaky cam to make you feel like you’re in the action—or possibly having a mild stroke. But that’s where the competence ends. The film pays tribute to bravery the same way a karaoke singer “pays tribute” to Whitney Houston—loud, passionate, and wildly off-key. Instead of showcasing coordinated heroics, Warfare gives us a team of soldiers who spend more time making bad tactical decisions than actually fighting. If military strategy was a game of chess, these guys are playing Hungry Hungry Hippos. The chain of command seems to be “whoever yells the loudest,” and at one point I’m fairly certain someone tried to call an airstrike using a selfie stick. All in all, Warfare tries to ride the coattails of better films but ends up tripping over its own plot holes. If you like your war movies with inexplicable slow-motion shots, and at least three scenes where someone yells “We’re surrounded!”—you might just enjoy this glorious mess. Final Verdict: Warfare is less “hoo-rah” and more “huh?”—but at least it looks good while failing"

The enemy is often unseen, adding tension and realism which culminates the platoon's retreat and some members severely wounded. I will definitely praising for it's visceral and immersive depiction of modern combat, it's realistic portrayal of chaos and war, and strong performances of the cast, includes D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Will Poulter, and Cosmo Jarvis for their committed and effective roles of playing soldiers under duress. However, the story is rooted in a real mission experienced by Mendoza and his platoon, aims to honor those who served, as well as Elliott Miller, who was gravely injured during the actual events and has no memory of them."

A film wonderfully directed by its co-directors and perfectly crafted in sound, it's worth watching with our full attention and dedication, because we're in the presence of one of the great war films of recent times, with all its skill in making us feel like we're in a documentary and, at times, a video game that unsettles, scares, and stresses you out, yet is satisfying."

And honestly, the film *delivers* on a lot: the realism is brutal, the performances hit every emotional note, and visually, it’s a gritty stunner. Garland’s writing shines, no doubt. But somewhere in the middle, it just… let go of me. Like a soldier slipping through a comrade’s grasp. I *wanted* to care more, to feel that tight-knit bond between characters that great war films nail. Instead, I felt more like a detached observer than a comrade in the trenches. Maybe I hyped it too hard in my head, but compared to the giants of the genre, this just didn’t punch hard enough. It’s a technically impressive piece, but emotionally? Left me cold. Still worth a watch—just don’t march in expecting a masterpiece. 2.5 stars."

Does the family whose house is destroyed get any explanation to justify their lives and home being ripped apart?

The film excels at immersing you in the visceral experience of combat – the deafening blasts and disorienting echoes truly place you alongside the soldiers. Ray Mendoza's story, one of survival and the unbreakable bonds of brotherhood, feels deeply personal, almost a thank you note to those who've kept him alive. While the lack of extensive backstories or a central character might leave you wanting deeper connections with individuals, this deliberate choice keeps the focus squarely on the relentless tension of survival. However, if you crave intense, expertly choreographed action sequences that leverage incredible surround sound to replicate the chaos of the frontlines, then \"Warfare\" is a must-see. The sound design team deserves high praise for their outstanding work, making this a compelling experience for any true cinephile."

The film is basically in two parts - before the chaos and during the chaos. Not having ever served in an active war zone, I can only assume that Warfare portrays the conditions of such a situation accurately. And just as in the movies, Blackhawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, there are several times when you are on the edge of your seat (one in particular when you may come out of it). However, what those other films had that I think is lacking in Warfare was virtually no character development and an almost documentary like approach to the telling of the events as they unfolded. Clearly, to be in the position those men were would be nightmarish and I left the theater with even greater respect for those who have endured such experiences. And the “straight and narrow” approach to telling the story did result in one positive factor, in my opinion. The movie was only 95 minutes long."

The movie was a bit slow for the majority of it, and the realism of soldiers standing in the openness of the street without cover, was a bit much. I dont wanna state all my gripes, but the movie was alright, but the title of it didnt really match what I thought itd be like based on how the story went in comparison to the title. I get fights are never a nice sight to see. I just feel like the title was a bit of an overstatement compared to how the movie played out."

      "review": "More a cinematic experience than narrative story, writer-director Alex Garland and Iraqi-War-veteran-turned-film-technical-advisor Ray Mendoza's film provides no exposition, no character backstories, no manipulative musical score, and definitely no holding back in putting us smack in the middle of an active engagement with a platoon of Navy SEALs fighting in Ramadi, Iraq who finds themselves trapped in a building surrounded by enemy combatants. Re-constructed from Mendoza's memories and that of his unit, the incident is meticulously re-created on-screen in real time, beginning with their terrifying invasion of a local family home. Cleverly and crucially, the film takes its time with that quieter “first act” to set up a few of the characters whilst cranking up tensions as we wait for the inevitable onslaught. An ensemble of fine young up-and-comers, like Shogun's white-guy; new Johnny Storm, a Heartstopper, and both the son of Soprano and Rambo, certainly help define some of its often interchangeable and similar looking characters and lessen the confusion which can arise when hellish chaos takes over the rest of the film for a visceral attack on our senses. It's relentless and entirely edge-of-your-seat stuff which soon becomes unbearably real, exhausting to watch but also strangely moving. There's limited lip service paid to the depiction of the 'other side', but that's because it's formulated intrinsically as a subjective film only from the POV of the Western forces. Together with a remarkably affecting and tumultuous sound design, it fulfills its singular objective to give us as accurate as possible a cinematic depiction of warfare in order to make an unequivocal and powerful point about the horrifying brutality and futility of war. There's no politics, no heroics or heroes, and absolutely no glory here in an overwhelmingly intense 95mins runtime which I'm glad I only had to experience it once on-screen."

Idiots. The realism and the perfect reconstitution of facts are based on the Navy Seals experience in that exact house and city in Iraq. The filmography is breath taking. There is no extra BS to add to an episode that is sufficient to itself and illustrates the war the US brought to the Middle-East. No moral, no opinion is offered, which is refreshing. It talks for itself: US troops with engagement rules and heavy equipment facing mobile and determined \"insurgents\"."

The plot being told in real time makes it rather captivating too, the tone of either trepidation or torment is omnipresent. Well, I say omnipresent, that's taking out the opening scene. I was not expecting that! Very fun though and a good way to show a snapshot of the camaraderie. It shouldn't work because it's not like it matches the rest of the film, but I gotta say I really loved it. What a tune, by the way. It's a fairly stacked cast list, from Will Poulter to Joseph Quinn to Charles Melton to Michael Gandolfini to D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai. No-one actually stands out individually, but I think that's entirely a good thing because it obviously isn't a story about any one person - it's about all of them."

It's a superb film, but one that might be hard to watch again. Written and directed by Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza this film reflects the real experience of Mendoza and his time as a Navy Seal in Iraq. Expressly one day, November 19, 2006. His Alpha team take over a house in Ramadi to oversee and protect a Marines operation. The film is set in real time, a span of about 90 minutes as the team wait and watch. But all hell breaks loose when they are attacked. The sound design of this film places you directly in the action. It's intense and gripping at all times. Mendoza has stated this film is a 'what film' and not a 'why film'. Which is true as I think this film replicates what it might feel like to be involved in war. The film makers have assembled a very talented young cast who are all very good. Especially Cosmo Jarvis, Joseph Quinn and D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai. A unique and unsettling film experience. But definitely not a relaxing one."

It is absolutely incredible. When it ended, you could hear a pin drop in the theater. Go see it, sit back and enjoy the tension. This film commands and deserves your attention."

I do like them and after a slow start once the attack starts I was riveted to the screen. The visuals and audio are fantastic. Top notch all the way. I could see this movie getting an Oscar nomination in one of those categories. It's intense. There are many gruesome scenes so this is not for the faint of heart but from what I have been told this really depicts what being in a battle is like and it's hell."

To my surprise, Warfare turned out to be one of the most heartbreakingly beautiful films I’ve seen so far. It’s raw, beutiful and aching in the best way. The visual cinematography, the choreography, the pacing, the sound... pure cinematic poetry! I had chills all the way through. By the time the credits rolled, I was covered in goosebumps. Easily one of the best movies of the year. Huge thanks to Alex, Ray, and the incredible veterans for this unforgettable event."

If you are seeking a narrative focused on the impacts on and tales of Iraqi civilians, you are in the wrong place. I don't necessarily think that it's a bad thing the directors, producers and writers choose to do this, coming from the direction they do, 'Warfare' highlights in real time military decision making as well as the profound damage war has on any party involved."

It’s so gritty, violent, and real that you can’t leave without feeling a sense of adrenaline. You could feel a chill amongst your fellow movie goers, like even though we were all strangers, we were all together on this journey and visceral experience. The sound was expertly executed, like you were on the battlefield with your own weapon. The IED explosion rocked me out of my seat basically. This is an experience and journey meant to be experienced in a move theater, and one that makes you truly realize the sacrifices and horrors of war these men and women make that will humble you to your core."

The realism was striking, and the sound design played a major role in immersing me. The film captures the essence of deployment lifelong stretches of monotony punctuated by brief, intense moments of chaos. Without giving too much away, watching Warfare felt like stepping back into the early 2000s. Its a powerful, grounded portrayal that deserves much more recognition. I would highly recommend watching this movie, especially in the theatres. There is no way to capture the sound design at your home."

      "review": "I felt like I was part of team, dropped into chaos of relentless battlefield. This movie, bold foray into gritty war drama, hit me like shockwave. From opening scene, shaky cam and deafening sound design plunged me into ambush in Iraq’s Anbar Province, circa 2007. It’s not just movie, it’s sensory assault that mirrors disorientation of combat. Playing as composite of real life operators, cast, led by stoic yet haunted lead, nails brotherhood and quiet intensity of elite operators. Plot doesn’t reinvent genre: high stakes mission to neutralize terrorist cell goes sideways, forcing team to navigate hostile city. But it’s execution that sets it apart. Dialogue feels ripped from actual comms, terse, tactical, human. No heroics, just desperate decisions under fire. Film’s strength is authenticity, reportedly shaped by veteran consultants. Every reload, every room clearance, feels procedural yet unpredictable. Urban combat scenes, blending drones and practical effects, are claustrophobic and brutal. Nighttime raid lit only by night vision and muzzle flashes had my heart pounding. Yet, it’s not all adrenaline. Quieter moments, like operator grappling with civilian casualty, cut deep, showing psychological toll without preaching. I left theater rattled, grateful for glimpse into world I’ll never know firsthand."

      "review": "Almost all of us can only imagine the horrors of war. Last year, director Alex Garland showed us war from the perspective of journalists in CIVIL WAR, which was great. Now, he is back again, this time codirecting and cowriting with Iraq war veteran Ray Mendoza, who was his military supervisor last year. WARFARE features a platoon of soldiers in an incident of war in Iraq in 2006, namely, Mendoza’s own platoon. They have extremely talented actors including D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai as Ray, Will Poulter as Erik, Joseph Quinn as Sam, Charles Melton as Jake, Cosmo Jarvis as Elliot, and Michael Gandolfini as McDonald. All give top-tier performances. This is definitely one of those A24 movies that might not do well in the box office but is a one-of-a-kind experience. This is the most intense anxiety-inducing movie I’ve ever seen. It’s visceral, dirty, disorientating, and just feels real. Having no music, it relies on some of the best sound design I’ve ever heard. The gunfire is loud and everywhere. The explosions rock you to the core. This and the smooth handheld camera work makes for complete immersion. My boots were on the ground. This was made to be seen in the theaters. The filmmakers aren’t interested in the typical Hollywood format. It has no character development, no background as to what these soldiers are doing there. You get as much context as they do, relying on their radio communications and what’s going on around them. It expects you to pick up on details like the military terminologies and equipment they use. It goes through each character’s reactions as it unfolds, whether it’s becoming shellshocked, being in unimaginable pain, or just being reckless. You can be the most prepared person in the world, you still won’t know how you’ll react in a warzone. The first half has a slow build, but it’s just establishing where you are and who’ll you’re with. This is the kind of movie A24 should be supporting. No other studio would’ve touched this one. It doesn’t shy away from anything. From a narrative perspective, it could’ve been better, but I’m going to forgive them this time because this is literally based on their recollection of what happened. Garland had said he stepped back a little directorially to give Mendoza the chance to tell his story, while Mendoza successfully resisted the temptation to make himself the hero. No politics, just survival. I understand this could be triggering for some people, but I still would implore you to go support this unique experience on a big screen with big sound. Remember, there are no winners in WARFARE."
