      "review": "Probably the last good thing to come from Star Wars before Darth Kennedy and Dave Filoni took over the franchise and nuked it from orbit. This showing was in 4D IMAX, and it was wild. The seats moved in six axes with the action on screen, there was a smoke machine and water most sprayers for the battle on Kashyyyk, and even strobe lights in the ceiling which would flash whenever two lightsabers struck together. A magnificent movie, even if the dialogue and script are a bit wooden at times - that's part of the charm."

Not only did I enjoy reenacting every cheesy, meme-worthy line, but the action kept me fully engaged from start to finish. I recommend skipping the first half of the sequel trilogy and instead watching The Clone Wars animated series, with this film serving as a fitting finale to the Old Republic arc of the Star Wars saga."

As a lifelong fan, I gotta say: this one still *slaps*. Sure, the CGI hasn‚Äôt aged gracefully (some scenes look like a PlayStation 2 cutscene), but the heart, drama, and sheer epicness still land. The final hour? Peak Star Wars. Dark, operatic, and absolutely essential to the mythos. From \"Hello there\" to \"You were the chosen one!\"‚Äîit‚Äôs packed with unforgettable lines that made the franchise legendary. Hayden and Ewan give it their all, and that fateful duel on Mustafar is still burned into my brain.

      "review": "If ever a film you have seen is coming to the theaters and you feel slightly compelled, that will grow once you decided to see it as intended. Apparently for most films nowadays they are being first watched on smaller screens, rather than the platform that originated in the art form since the presented projection. The form consists of storytelling deliverances with thematic and performative impacts whilst presenting expressive momentum from different production merits attributing to heighten the collective effect instilled by the film. In arguable contrary, there is a more defining first impression awaits as a more rightful experience that truly marks the film for what it is, per scope‚Äôs requirement or potential crowd-pleaser. While my first introduction to Star Wars was for a while through ‚ÄúThe Clone Wars‚Äù with little gist of the lore, formally leaning towards the main films was preferably chronological, starting with the prequel trilogy. There was only little appreciation to the cumulative efforts beneath the enjoyment without critical realization such as how much of a classic the original trilogy is while the prequels practically pale in comparison, until decidedly seeing ‚ÄúRevenge of the Sith‚Äù on the big screen recently. When watching Episode III‚Äôs direct predecessors, they are mere practice in response to innovative technology with little focus in solidifying the narrative buildup, resulting in constant problematic executions as well both being dimensionally flat. The climatic finale was initially seen decent at best with its darker evolution sank the defining chapter as the least. However, upon re-evaluating those films in anticipation of III‚Äôs re-release in coinciding with its 20th anniversary, the film not only rose in ranking but retrospectively improves to realize it is truly one of the franchise‚Äôs best, solely for its unexpectedly profound operatic sensation, which frankly not quite dimensional elsewhere in validating the categorization when the Force was really strong in this one. From an innocent, gifted child upon introduction to loyal but hormonal student mastering the Jedi way, there is slight dread in watching Anakin‚Äôs journey through the prequel trilogy‚Äôs first two chapters, knowing his mechanical fate. This film‚Äôs narrative position reminds us that this is where his dark downfall begins, yet the film attempts to reset that knowledge with hope of prevented destiny only lingering as misleading and make it all more tragic. Series creator George Lucas, who previously directed and written ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù (‚ÄúA New Hope‚Äù), somehow could not deliver that stellar deftness for the prequels due to the unbalanced focus when writing solely around innovative visuals rather than solidifying a narrative foundation like before. This film, however, came to his defense without saving the first two prequels as this story is his true aim after struggling in bringing balance to the Force regarding the young Skywalker‚Äôs journey eventually becoming Darth Vader. Most of the noteworthy flaws, as considerable essences, have improved to validate the operatic dimension when involving awaiting destinies that inevitably transitions onto the classic for sake of consistency. Trekking through a more polished spectacle that makes the troubled worldbuilding worth the progress is the performances finally showing executive acceptance to comfortably weigh those lines, to the evocative emotionally resonating extent of utter conviction. Ian McDiarmid refines his nuanced continuous portrayal of Palpatine/Darth Sidious with a more fleshed out psychological storyline and justifying the transformative threat with glee. Both Samuel L. Jackson and Natalie Portman as Mace Windu and Padme Amidala are also narratively strengthened amid the story‚Äôs impending bleak times through sharp ethics and getting overwhelmed emotionally (easily, even when characteristically pregnant), respectively, while the latter builds her character‚Äôs chemistry with genuineness. Frank Oz edges his iconic voice as Yoda with attempted grit in confronting the growing threat, thus evolving his character from puppetry constraints to a skillfully action-packed, expressively instinctual role. Finally, much like the iconic lightsaber battle of two brothers, two longtime friends, a teacher and his padawan, both Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor piercingly perfected their roles that they were cast for from the beginning. They have transcended the required emotions for palpable tangibility to the level that both solely risen the operatic impression with stunning effect in their nuanced deliverances, especially Christensen greatly improving his participation. The stunning visuals ‚Äì putting it mildly ‚Äì and the gradually mustered powerhouses may have achieved the notable height that verifies the franchise‚Äôs epic space opera core when not adventurous nor riveting, what ultimately powers them is John Williams also amping his part. As a constant composer through the Skywalker Saga, he started becoming a welcoming trait that continues on from coming off impressive in the classics, celebrative in the sequels and sensual in the prequels, until he really took his score to the next heightened level that puts us in an astonishing grip over what he conjured in comparison to his iconic pieces. This debatably borderlines theatrical exclusivity when merely amazes elsewhere but not at the enveloping level of watching those powerful sequences on a screen that looms at a scale that usually accommodate an opera, and Williams gives the right push for such sensation. Not only did he heightened his mastery akin to Lucas‚Äô growing vision, but he also responded poetically to the visual theming with impeccable synchroneity. Besides few hindrances from an unsubstantially gimmicky ‚Äúantagonist‚Äù to few questionable executions that validates the noted unevenness, ‚ÄúStar Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith‚Äù is a redemptive testament that stands as its trilogy‚Äôs needed peak and suitable transition into the originals. This film has been held in high regards similar to those classics regarding the storytelling impact that continuously ripples across the evolving franchise, particularly ‚ÄúThe Clone Wars‚Äù then its televised successors that contributed in characterized layers to deepen the grasped depths that were initially witnessed here. While that trilogy is held as high like any classic films for being pure cinema by adventurous innovations, then replicating the experience itself for new generations was attempted in the sequel trilogy‚Äôs celebrative, ranging interpretations as current artistic impression gaze, this trilogy of the first prequels (not counting ‚ÄúRogue One‚Äù or ‚ÄúSolo‚Äù, which both been ranked superior) firstly replicated its predecessors‚Äô sensations in great mixture that improves by little when solely leading up to the climatic phenomenon. These stories get projected on the screen and continue with maintained entertainment values depend on the retrospective. Both ‚ÄúA New Hope‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Force Awakens‚Äù, and maybe ‚ÄúThe Empire Strikes Back‚Äù, should be seen on the big screen just like how ‚ÄúRevenge of the Sith‚Äù ‚Äì imperfect by contrast ‚Äì proven that realization when justifying the franchise‚Äôs categorization as epic space operas than just mere scope. (B+)"

      "review": "After rewatching this movie on its 20 year anniversary, I have some things to say. The dialogue towards the beginning is a bit silly, I will admit that. However, around the middle of the film when Palpatine tells Anakin the Sith story and reveals himself to be a Sith Lord, that‚Äôs when things really start to become superb. It really does hold up after all this time in almost every way and the CGI looks really good too. The lightsaber action and choreography are at its best and most well done yet. While it is truly sad what ends up happening, you're pretty invested in it emotionally and the film does what it‚Äôs supposed to in an epic way. Plus, it brings it all back together in a beautiful way eventually with the original trilogy. The Star Wars score, characters, fun, and universe overall do not let me down one bit in this film!"

It delivers everything you expect from a Star Wars film, and more. The action scenes are arguably the best in the entire saga: every fight, every duel is filmed with incredible intensity, and the final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan on Mustafar is truly memorable. Anakin's character is very well developed. We witness his gradual decline, his transformation from hero to traitor, and it's all beautifully orchestrated. The character's internal dilemmas, conflicts, and frustrations are magnified by Hayden Christensen's performance, which portrays an Anakin who is both human and tragic. This film also leads to a nostalgic ending, perfectly in keeping with the original trilogy. We feel this seamless transition between the events of Anakin and the rise of the Empire, thus providing an emotional conclusion that brilliantly ties the two trilogies together."

I used to worry about Disney ruining Star Wars, but upon and upon revisiting Episode III for only the second time (once in theaters when it was new) I've realized that actually they saved Star Wars from George Lucas. I thought this was the least bad of the first three episodes, but I'm not sure anymore... it's wholly unwatchable at this point. Natalie Portman, who is an outstanding actor, gives the flattest performance of her career. She's literally only in the movie to die I'm childbirth which is hugely disappointing. Haden Christensen's turn to the dark side is mostly unbelievable and his abs are the only thing notable about his performance. The CGI is so heavily overused that they couldn't even bother to put a storm trooper in an actual costume, instead they sloppily place a human head on a CGI body. Samuel L Jackson was his normal self, which I generally live, but he was poorly cast to be in these movies. The only redeeming thing about this movie was minimal Jar Jar Binks..."

      "review": "Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, directed by George Lucas, is the third and final film within the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The third film follows Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker's tragic and upsetting transformation into sith lord Darth Vader. As the Clone Wars wager on and political corruption spreads through the Republic, loyalties of everyone in the galaxy are tested and relationships are shattered. The story shows the fall of loved heroes, the rise of an evil empire, and the breaking of bonds that fanatics of Star Wars have loved for years. Revenge of the Sith terrifically balances large scale conflicts with personal heartbreak and drama, creating a film that is not only entertaining but very moving. What sets Revenge of the Sith apart from some of the other movies in the saga is how masterful it is at really bringing together all aspects of a good film. The cinematography, directed by David Tattersall, is just fantastic. From the battles on foreign planets of the galaxy to the intimate, darker moments with characters you have bonded with, every shot is packed with an intense atmosphere. Shifting toward darker, moodier lighting perfectly mirrors the narrative turn into tragedy. Most recognizable are the fight scenes, choreographed with an intensity and fluid-ness that still stands among the best action sequences in modern cinema, and in my opinion, best of the entire collection. John Williams' composing deserves its own standing ovation. His compositions for Revenge of the Sith are able to elevate every scene, from the grand \"Battle of the Heroes\" to the devastating \"Anakin's Betrayal.\" The music displays the film‚Äôs emotional weight while never being overpowering, creating a connection between the audience and the characters' ups and downs. Williams is able to use his composition to truly display character development and emotions, making this soundtrack one of the franchise‚Äôs most memorable to date. The editing done by Roger Barton and Ben Burtt, is also very well balanced. Despite there being a large amount of narrative ground the film has to cover, it rarely feels rushed or panicked. Key emotional areas of the film are given the space they need to land, while action scenes move with thrilling, perfectly timed momentum. Burtt also served as sound designer, using his skills to create an immersive experience, from blasters firing, rumbling of ships, to lightsaber duels, he captured the audience effectively. In terms of storytelling, Revenge of the Sith achieves something special. The film manages to fulfill fan expectations while delivering unfortunate, devastating surprises. Knowing Anakin‚Äôs fate does not lessen the film‚Äôs emotions, instead, George Lucas‚Äôs skilled directing shows how small, tragic decisions succumb to unchangeable downfall. While some earlier prequel lines could be clunky or even forced, Revenge of the Sith had significant, needed improvement. During crucial parts of the film for the storyline, the verbal exchanges between Anakin and Obi-Wan are powerful, showing their brotherly bond, how close they are to each other, and their unfortunate eventual heartbreak. Hayden Christensen is often criticized for his performance in Attack of the Clones. Within Revenge of the Sith he delivers a truly outstanding portrayal of Anakin‚Äôs inner conflict. Ewan McGregor‚Äôs performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi is also beautiful, displaying a balance between strength, sorrow, and compassion that brings the film together emotionally. For 2005, the film‚Äôs visual effects are outstanding and still hold up well today. Entire digital environments like the planets Mustafar and Coruscant feel very real as if they really exist. The sets are impressive yet practical, as well as the costumes for what their purpose was. Lucas‚Äô vision for a deteriorating galaxy was made with beautiful attention to detail. If there are any weaknesses in the film, it is in some of the side character developments. Padm√© Amidala, who is played by Natalie Portman, starts strong but becomes a more passive, almost side character as the film progresses. Given Padm√©'s importance within the series, I feel some Star Wars fanatics wish her character would have been given even more of a role in the final act. However, Natalie Portman brings depth to her role, and her scenes with Anakin carry some heavy weight adding to their development, leading to tragedy. As for the Star Wars saga, Revenge of the Sith is an essential part for understanding the saga. It closes the gap between the prequels and the original trilogy, giving new development to characters like Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi, as for many people may not have fully understood the characters of the first trilogy. It reassesses the understanding of certain characters in the Star Wars universe, making Luke and Leia‚Äôs future struggles and events even more meaningful. Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith is/was an absolute achievement in the world of filmmaking. It successfully combines thrilling action, emotional stories, and technical and editing mastery. George Lucas delivered a powerful, tragic film that resonates beyond just being a Star Wars fan, offering insight into friendship, loyalty, and the consequences of fear and ambition, good or bad. With very minor weaknesses, the film holds a very important place in the Star Wars saga and is cherished among fanatics and movie history. I personally give Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith a 90/100. Happy 20th anniversary!!!"

      "review": "Revenge of the Sith is one of the more mature and dark entries in the Star Wars saga. Anakin Skywalker's ultimate fall and rise as Darth Vader, orchestrated by the Sith's machinations, is the payoff audiences had been waiting for since 1977. While some dialogue and narrative choices remain questionable, Episode III is undoubtedly the best of the prequel trilogy. The film also boasts a standout performance from Ian McDiarmid, with Palpatine being more deliciously sinister than ever. Moreover, George Lucas's decision to shoot the movie digitally brings multiple planets to life in a visually stunning way."

      "review": "When I first watched Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, I was thirteen years old and had never seen a Star Wars movie in my life. My dad took the whole family to see it, and from the moment the film started, I was completely entranced. Anakin Skywalker‚Äôs desperate struggle to save his wife from death‚Äîand his inevitable fall to the dark side‚Äîhit me like a freight train. I wasn‚Äôt just watching a movie; I was feeling it. His choices, his heartbreak, his rage ‚Äî they were raw and devastating. By the time Anakin became Darth Vader, I was emotionally wrecked in the best way possible. When we got home, my dad casually dropped the bomb that there were more Star Wars films. Naturally, I devoured every single one of them ‚Äî but Revenge of the Sith still stands tallest. The level of detail in the world-building, the groundbreaking CGI that still holds up today, and most importantly, Hayden Christensen‚Äôs gripping performance as Anakin, were absolutely phenomenal. Watching him slowly become consumed by the dark side was like watching a slow-motion train wreck ‚Äî horrifying, inevitable, and mesmerizing. Out of all the Star Wars movies, this one is, without question, my favorite. It‚Äôs more than just a film; it‚Äôs a tragedy wrapped in the colors of a galaxy far, far away. And for me, it was the gateway to a lifelong love of Star Wars. Simply put: Best. Movie. Ever."

Being fully immersed into the movie with the 4DX effects made it feel like I was right there in the middle of the action. I‚Äôve always kept up with the Star Wars movies, but when Revenge of the Sith originally came out, I was about six years old. I don‚Äôt recall ever going to the movies to see it back then, so being able to finally experience one of the prequel films in theaters as an adult was truly special. This movie has always been one of my favorites, and in my opinion, it‚Äôs easily the best out of the three prequels when it comes to showing Anakin‚Äôs heartbreaking transformation into Darth Vader. That final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan was so powerful and emotional ‚Äî it really hits you in the heart. And the scene with Padm√© begging Anakin to leave everything behind and not fall to the dark side? Absolutely gut-wrenching. If you live near a theater that offers 4DX, I highly recommend seeing it in that format for the full immersive experience. But even if you can‚Äôt, just being able to watch Revenge of the Sith on the big screen again ‚Äî after all these years since 2005 ‚Äî is an amazing experience in itself. Don‚Äôt miss it!"

      "review": "Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith (2005), directed by George Lucas, concludes the prequel trilogy by chronicling Anakin Skywalker's tragic storyline. Set against the backdrop of the galaxy-spanning Clone Wars, the film follows Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker's growing disillusionment with the Jedi Council and his internal struggles with fear, anger, and love. The movie charts the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the tyrannical Galactic Empire, setting the stage for the events of the original Star Wars trilogy. The story balances action, political intrigue, and personal tragedy. Lucas crafts a narrative that is both epic in scope and intimate in its portrayal of Anakin's fall. For new viewers, it serves as a tragic turning point; for longtime fans, it fills in long-awaited answers. Revenge of the Sith is often considered the strongest of the prequel trilogy, and for good reason. One of the film‚Äôs biggest strengths lies in its visual storytelling. The cinematography, led by David Tattersall, embraces a rich, dynamic palette. Worlds like Mustafar, with its violent rivers of lava, and Coruscant‚Äôs gleaming cityscape, are rendered with detailed CGI that holds up remarkably well even today. The action sequences, particularly the final duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi, are filmed with intensity and emotional weight. John Williams' musical score deserves special praise. His compositions for this film, especially tracks like ‚ÄúBattle of the Heroes‚Äù and the haunting strains accompanying Padm√©'s final moments, elevate the emotional core of the story. The score weaves familiar Star Wars themes with new motifs that mirror Anakin‚Äôs descent and the Republic‚Äôs downfall, making the experience deeply immersive. However, the film is not without its weaknesses. While Hayden Christensen delivers a more complex performance as Anakin compared to Attack of the Clones, some of his dialogue still feels stale and melodramatic. Natalie Portman, as Padm√©, is given less to do than in previous entries; her arc feels underdeveloped and overly reliant on her romantic entanglement with Anakin rather than showcasing the importance her character displayed earlier in the trilogy. A consistent critique of the prequels has been their sometimes clunky dialogue, and Revenge of the Sith is no exception. Lines like \"You are so beautiful,\" followed by \"Only because I‚Äôm so in love,\" while meant to portray tender affection, often land awkwardly. That said, the emotional climax of the film is handled with more gravity and authenticity than previous scenes. Christensen's portrayal of Anakin's conflict feels real, raw, and devastating. In terms of its genre and franchise positioning, Revenge of the Sith is crucial. It bridges the often-criticized prequel trilogy with the beloved original trilogy masterfully. It offers fans an emotional payoff for sticking with the sometimes uneven journey. For fans of epic space opera, tragedy, or action, the film delivers a layered, consequential narrative that transcends its genre trappings. Marketing and reception further highlight the film‚Äôs significance. The trailers emphasized the dark tone and showcased key emotional beats without giving too much away. Posters, notably the one featuring Anakin‚Äôs shadow forming Darth Vader‚Äôs silhouette, cleverly hinted at the inevitable transformation. On social media and fan forums, the film was praised at the time for finally delivering the mature, dark Star Wars story that many had been craving since The Phantom Menace. Today, it's frequently re-evaluated as one of the saga‚Äôs best entries, especially in light of how it connects to recent Star Wars media like The Clone Wars animated series and Obi-Wan Kenobi series. Revenge of the Sith succeeds in telling a tragic, powerful story within the expansive Star Wars universe. Its strengths in visual design, emotional storytelling, and musical composition significantly outweigh its few weaknesses in dialogue and character development. Overall, Revenge of the Sith is a captivating movie that delivers a tragic and memorable story. I rate it 9/10, especially for its emotional weight, impressive visuals, and importance to the Star Wars saga. It's a must-watch for fans and a deeply rewarding cinematic experience for those who appreciate stories of downfall and redemption."

And the closing chapter in the prequel trilogy has it all. The bond between Hayden and Ewan has always felt genuine and the acting in this one you feel the heartbreak, as you do with Padme. There will never be a lightsaber duel that comes close to Anakin vs. Obi-Wan. Truly an epic."

This film maintains steller pacing and wastes no time on any of the many plot points. I really appreciate how this is a film that anyone can watch, whether they know the Star Wars timeline and backstory or not. From the galactic battle, into the Chancellor's Rescue, to following Anakin‚Äôs descent into darkness and Obi-Wan‚Äôs mission going from serving the Republic, to protecting the ones he loves from his old friend. This epic segway into Star Wars:A New Hope was just incredible. Rewatching it, I could not believe how much the film actually covers in it‚Äôs 2 hour and 20 minute time period. John Williams, like always, is incredible. His scores left goosebumps on my arms the entire time rewatching it. Skywalker Sound still maintains to be the greatest sound design company, and hearing it all in XD was a dream come true. That being said, there is some lines in this film that are just hard to hear. You can tell that many of the actors did not understand what they were saying and a lot did not feel natural. The transitions were often something to be desired as well. Hayden and Ewan‚Äôs chemistry with each other was just incredible though. You can really feel the gravity from the final battle. Overall, this film aged like fine wine and I am so glad it is getting the recognition it deserves in theatres again."

Stupid flips and unnecessary spins of lightsabers also make it hard to immerse yourself in this world. While on lightsabers, how the heck do they not throw any light on any character/surface. Mcdiarmid has his best work as the Emperor in this one but this is soured by the above and more crucially the final 10 minutes in which the greatest Jedi Master thus far simply gives up for no real reason in his battle with Palpatine, where only the freedom of the galaxy is at stake, and then Padme, an instant after birthing two twins, suddenly has no reason to live?!? Yes most mothers would definitely abandon their newborns because their father has gone evil I'm sure. Even worse though is originally in ROTJ Lucas writes that Leia remembers Padme, what in the 15s they were alive together? Does Lucas even proofread his work???

The story of the film is my absolute favorite. A Jedi falling to the dark side to become one of the most infamous villains in cinema history is a really cool story. Easily one of the best Star Wars films, besides Episode 5 of course."

The whole thing is good until they enter the ship to save the Chancellor. Why‚Ä¶.in the hell‚Ä¶did they make the robots have stupid ass voices? So they go to save Palpatine and Dooku arrives. Obi Wan is knocked out and Vader cuts off Dooku‚Äôs hands and head‚Ä¶.pretty brutal. I have NO idea how Dooku was surprised when Palpatine turned on him‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúYeah, duh.‚Äù Red Flag #1 ignored by Vader: he goes to pick up the knocked out McGregor and Palpatine is all ‚Äúleave him or we won‚Äôt make it‚Äù and Vader wasn‚Äôt like ‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù So they get captured by Grievous (amazing in the mini-series but criminally underused like Maul), he escapes, everyone is safe and Vader just ditches people congratulating him to kiss and hug Padme‚Ä¶out in the open. *Sigh* Vader is denied a council seat and whines like a baby after which Yoda and Nick Fury question the prophecy and ask him to spy for them. Red flag #2 ignored by Vader: Palpatine knows he was asked by the Jedi to spy on him and tells him the story of Darth Plageuis the Wise, a Sith Legend‚Ä¶really bro? So Obi Wan is a cocky SOB and confronts Grievous alone, surrounded by hundreds of droids as Vader FINALLY finds out the Chancellor is the Sith Lord. Vader tells Nick Fury and instead of showing up with any of the literal hundreds of Jedi on Coruscant, he shows up with 3 Jedi to confront the Sith Lord. Sidious immediately kills Squid face, horn man, and unimportant 3rd Jedi before he, arguably, loses to Nick Fury. Vader takes Fury‚Äôs arm off and he falls out a window while electrocuted. Vader destroys the temple, gets them yellow sith eyes, kills kids (despite knowing he will be a dad soon ‚Äì poor form I say), and kills the separatist leaders before choking his wife (in the not sexual, un-fun way) and fighting Obi Wan. Obi Wan turns Vader into a burned piece of bacon while Yoda falls down‚Ä¶which means he loses??? So he flies off into exile, Obi Wan separates the kids after birth and the Death Star is being built. Oh and they show a bunch of Jedi being killed, it‚Äôs kind of sad. Obi Wan kills someone with a gun..... Fun fact: The reason Palpatine knows about Vader spying on him, the kids he‚Äôs having with Padme, and all this other crap is because he employs in his company an alien with telepathic powers to read minds. It‚Äôs never mentioned in the movie."

It is my favourite of the six (REAL) Star Wars movies in the skywalker saga. It had THE BEST choreographed lightsaber duel to date, a superb plot, and a great use of it's time on the screen. It's not a rushed \"anakin has grown disillusioned with the jedi,\" it doesn't happen off screen, we see anakin's descent, and it feels more true, more earnt by the end. Not only was the battle of the heroes (or the duel between anakin and obi-wan kenobi for the layman) had emotional undertones of great significance and power, and as previously mentioned, had extremely good choreography. It wasn't the only well choreographed fight in this film alone however, there was also the duel at the beginning, anakin and obi-wan, versus count dooku, and general grevious and obi wan, and of course, yoda and palpatine. The fact it's at 66% is just Disney trying to push away the prequels with some... shady tactics, cus apparently they need to hate on the prequels to make the sequels look better. But with recent content, people are THIRSTY for jar jar nowadays. Anyway, 5 stars."

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the action is wonderfully choreographed, the backdrops are more gorgeous than any previous Star Wars film, and this is the best of the prequel trilogy in every way. However, it is the messages of Revenge of the Sith that are most poignant, and poignant they are. We currently face governments that are led by untouchable criminals who, like Palpatine, control the senate and the justice systems. The world is further to the right than I have seen in my lifetime. Yet, these leaders appear to have the common person‚Äôs interest at heart. Like Palpatine, they slither their way into supreme power with the most selfish of intentions at heart. As Padme says when witnessing Palpatine revel in his victory to the galactic senate, ‚Äúthis is how liberty dies ‚Äî with thunderous applause.‚Äù And with Anakin we see how someone is seduced into the influence of serpentine sophists and demagogues. Anakin feels undervalued by the righteous path. It is rigorous and grueling to become a jedi master, yet it is seductive to become a sith. Palpatine promises to save the woman he loves. He convinces Anakin that only the dark side of the force can cheat death. Palpatine tells Anakin the story of Darth Plagueis, a sith who learned to cheat death but fell victim to murder by his apprentice. Yet, the irony is that it is in fact the jedi who learned the secret to immortality. This is simply a great story and, unfortunately, a very relevant one."

The first 30 minutes of the movie is very invigorating, the visuals, the sound design, the choreography was all perfect. The sudden twist of Dooku dying early in the movie, and Anakin killing him in cold blood was the first sign that this movie was not going to be like other movies. Once those first 30 minutes is done, it just becomes a step by step into most jaw dropping story ever. The second act of the movie just leaves you too stunned to speak. Seeing the fall of Anakin, Order 66, grievous' death, the end of the clone wars, the birth of the empire, just wow. The duel between Anakin and Obi Wan, Yoda and Sidious was perfect. Visually stunning, choreography on point, soundtrack hitting perfectly. Seeing Anakin being left to die by Obi Wan, Yoda accepting defeat was just heartbreaking. Finally we got to breath, seeing the birth of Luke and Leia, the transformation of Anakin into vader. What a scene. Even in this calm scene, we still saw padme die. Many people will consider Empire Strikes back the main story of tragedy, but no, this is the one. Seeing the good guys loose in such a manner was one unique experience. Once again, that hopeful ending helps in not making you completley depressed. Best movie of all time."

It delivers everything a Star Wars fan could hope for‚Äîepic lightsaber battles, stunning visuals, emotional depth, and a tragic yet compelling story that ties the prequel trilogy seamlessly into the original saga. The film perfectly captures Anakin Skywalker‚Äôs heartbreaking descent into Darth Vader, driven by love, fear, and manipulation. Hayden Christensen gives his best performance as Anakin, portraying his internal conflict with raw intensity, while Ewan McGregor shines as Obi-Wan Kenobi, delivering some of the most emotional moments in the franchise. Ian McDiarmid‚Äôs chilling portrayal of Emperor Palpatine is equally unforgettable, making every scene he‚Äôs in feel ominous and electrifying. From the breathtaking duel on Mustafar to John Williams‚Äô hauntingly beautiful score, Revenge of the Sith is packed with unforgettable moments. It‚Äôs a dark, tragic, and visually spectacular film that cements itself as one of the best in the Star Wars saga. A must-watch for any fan of the franchise!"

Recently, I rewatch it after so many years and I was still amazed. Even more, renowned art academic and art historian critic Camille Paglia, said Revenge of the Sith is the GREATEST work of art in the last 30 years!!! I realized I was right along all these years. She even said most movie critics and people nowadays have gotten used to toxic overpraise and are afraid to express their personal opinions which is 100% true. This proves many Hollywood Critics are toxic. The fact a renowned art academic and critic acknowleged the movie was the greatest work of art in our generation, proves Hollywood critics don't know what the fuck they are talking about.

      "review": "I felt the full spectrum of emotions while watching this film. While the first two prequels suffer from poor writing, acting and pacing, this movie overcomes them masterfully. The dialogue is much easier to digest, the acting is improved (especially by Hayden Christensen) and the film carries a weight and tension from start to finish. The storytelling is at a different level, with the juxtaposition in the final scenes illustrating so much more than birth and death. This film is the culmination of years of investment. From A New Hope to Attack of the Clones (regardless of quality), there is a depth to the characters and a third act payoff rarely accomplished in film. Seeing Anakin's fall from the Chosen One to a Sith Lord is captivating. The scenes with Palpatine's subtle manipulation (the booth, circling in the hallway, etc.) are sublime. All this tension leading to Anakin alone in the council room, split at the core with tears dripping down his face is why I watch movies. I could write an entire article just on the masterpiece that is the battle on Mustafar. There is a profound depth to every element in that scene. As an audience member, I care deeply about both characters. The relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin is finally broken as one expresses hate and the other love. They were brothers, spending more time in their life together than apart. This conflict is illustrated in their perfectly matched fighting style and the emotion brought forth by both characters. It might be the single best fight scene in cinema history. Seriously, I do not know if there is a better 1v1 battle with more emotional depth and a higher quality of fight choreography than this single scene. In the end, this film is not a celebration of Darth Vader, nor does it try to convey that the Jedi Order was perfect. \"Revenge of the Sith\" is a tragedy, plain and simple. From the dialogue seconds apart of \"I need him!\" contrasted with \"What have I done?\", the story of Darth Vader is brought full circle. I know this is controversial, but I believe that this is the single best film in the Star Wars franchise. Best Character: Palpatine Best Moment: Battle on Mustafar Best Quote: \"Good is a point of view, Anakin.\" - Palpatine"

The fight choreography is breathtaking, along with the unique biome and settings they are stationed into them. The plot shows the Fall of the infamous Darth Vader, so come on...who doesn't want to see that? I've watched this movie probably over 30 times (I'm sure there are people who have watched it more) And I don't plan on stopping! Thank you, George Lucas!"

The CGI has also had a noticeable upgrade, the opening sequence looks so good. Music is amazing as always, especially in the climax, which has one of the most iconic battles of all time, with some really powerful dialogue for once.

His portrayal of a Jedi struggling between his desire to do good and his fear of losing those he loves is deeply moving. Anakin's internal conflict and dreams of gaining more power to save lives lead him down a dark and heart-wrenching path. This film beautifully illustrates the tragic transformation into Darth Vader, making it the most compelling and emotionally charged installment in George Lucas's six-part saga. A perfect 10 out of 10, it's undoubtedly the best trilogy movie among all six of George Lucas's creations. This was my first star wars movie I saw in the theater, Hayden Christensen's performance was outstanding I was very moved my his acting and the storytelling. Not knowing alot of star wars I was intrigued to know more as soon as I went home my dad told me that there were more movies that we had that I could watch and I started from the beginning watching episode 4, 5, 6 and then found out we have 1 and 2 once this movie came out on DVD I watched it over and over again it's one of the best films of Star Wars I've ever seen."

Sin duda la mejor de todas las peliculas de Star Wars, con el mejor inicio siendo este la batalla en Coruscant donde ya podemos ver a Anakin mas maduro y habil, las batallas de utapao y kashyyyk con lo poco que se vio me dejo con ganas de una pelicula live action de las guerras clon. El duelo de Palpatine contra Yoda y el duelo de Anakin contra Obi-wan son de lo mejor de toda la saga. La pelicula no tiene relleno, todas sus escenas son importantes y ver a anakin caer es desgarrador, sobretodo cuando pelea contra su maestro y su considerado hermano. Verlo consumido en la ira nos entristece cuando hasta entonces lo vimos siendo uno de los mas grandes heroes de la republica, la orden 66 es muy triste e impactante sobretodo si viste la serie de The Clone Wars, la pelicula nos deja una melancolia con el final con todo aparentemente perdido. Ahora si, lo malo: la muerte de Padme pudo ser mejor. El general Grievous decepciona si viste la serie de Tartakovski, y el conde dooku muere muy rapido."

Anakin's transformation feels way too sudden, the creation of the greatest film villain of all time needed to feel a little bit more organic and natural.

Luckily we have already seen how it ends in the Original Trilogy and the rise from the darkness back to light.

Good action. Good story good acting. Good character development. No great character development. Compared to the newer Disney ones, this movie is awesome. Compared to the old ones, it does them Justice in a modern way with modern technology used. I have no complaints."

      "review": "In 1999 and 2002, George Lucas made 2 prequel movies that weren't very well received. In 2005, he concluded that trilogy with an absolute masterpiece. This movie is magnificent. The plot for this movie is phenomenal, Ewan McGregor was as charming as always, Hayden Christensen completely stepped up from the last movie becoming one of the coolest characters in Star Wars. The Order 66 scene, perhaps one of the greatest and most iconic scenes of all time, was executed perfectly, witnessing all the Jedi perish, and Anakin vs Obi-Wan was choreographed so well and is arguably the best Lightsaber Duel in all of Star Wars. Overall, a massive improvement over the previous 2 films and a great way to end the Prequel Trilogy."

      "review": "While the dialogue is very wooden at times, this is easily one of the best Star Wars movies to date. You feel the pain emanating from Christensen's Anakin, as despite his long-awaited turn to the dark side, you can still feel the conflict within him. The Battle on Mustafar, and the scene with Anakin and the clones are some of the most visually dazzling, if not also eerily haunting, moments from the entire film. It took them long enough, but both Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor have finally both fully settled into their roles as Anakin and Obi-Wan, and if you don't find yourself tearing up at some point due to the heart wrenching fact that brothers are now rivals, you may very well be more of a cyborg than Anakin himself. My final notes: this is a top 3 Star Wars movie, and could very well be one of the best movies of all time."

The duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin is iconic, and Order 66 is a dramatic and franchise-defining move carried out by the ever-evil Emperor Palpatine. The cast and characters in \"Revenge of the Sith\" gave amazing performances! Obi-Wan's lines are more quotable than ever. Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader is fascinating. General Grievous was a solid addition to the franchise. And we don't have to hear any of Jar Jar Binks's annoying lines! George Lucas has brought us a stunning conclusion to the Star Wars prequels!"
