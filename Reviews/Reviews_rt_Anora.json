There's an apparent authenticity that has you questioning whether that's actually real, or not, in a world most have no understanding of, nor exposure to. In combination, the aforementioned come together under SB's masterful creative eye, and deliver something unexpected - an emotional, perceptive, and intelligent action-thriller-drama. Brilliant!"

    "review": "All Time Classic. The first 45 minutes of this is a sex comedy and romance. It's really fast, feels like a dream, and funny too. Than the next 90 minutes is a straight nightmare almost. The tone change this undergoes in the middle for about 30 minutes is insane. It's as intense as any domestic abuse fighting scene you've ever seen. And it just keeps going and going and never lets up. And it also never lets up with the dark comedy as well. The editing and pacing overall is just masterful. The acting is excellent overall but Madison is incredible in this. Just incredible and elevates everything and everyone around her in this. Ivan is really good to and the film does a great job at portraying him as a naive rich kid who hasn't grown up but a likeable person who is a good fit for Madison. The music is really good too though I wish it was a bit more catchy and it really isn't used much at all in the second half of this (Rightfully so to). The direction is first rate and the cinematography is excellent. The setting themselves aren't that memroable but the acting and scenes themselves are so funny, intense, and you just can't look away at times. In general this becomes a domestic drama for most of the runtime but never feels like a seperate film either. Everyone should give this a try once."

    "review": "A film with more than a passing resemblance to Pretty Woman has Mikey Madison in a brilliant, star-making performance as a sex worker and the young adult son of a Russian oligarch in the Richard Gere role. The first half of the film follows Pretty Woman's template, and then in the second half takes an all together different turn when the young man's parents get involved, taking exception to the relationship and intervening. What could be a very uneasy mix of comedy and dark drama is held together by Madison, brilliant direction and editing from Sean Baker (who also wrote the film). The final scene is powerful and not a little disturbing, leaving a potentially strange taste in the mouth, but this is a film with heart, soul, and brain all functioning with aplomb."

She makes Anora impossible to pin down: one moment a wide-eyed dreamer, the next a woman fully aware of the stakes and playing the game to survive. Baker surrounds her with a cast of non-actors and professionals alike, grounding the film in the messy, unpredictable texture of real life. The brilliance of Anora lies in its refusal to judge. It‚Äôs not about victimhood or empowerment in the easy, slogan-ready sense. It‚Äôs about the cost of freedom when everything around you has a price tag. As with Red Rocket and Tangerine, Baker once again shines a light on the edges of society‚Äîonly this time, the heartbreak hits even harder. Unflinching, tragic, and unexpectedly tender, Anora is a modern-day fable with no heroes, just survivors. One of the year‚Äôs best!"

I have lost any respect for The Academy. I hate everyone who helped make this film, and waste my time. Every minute was stressful to watch, outside the pornogrpahy, it was a stressful journey of fighting, yelling, non-stop noise. Breaking things, running around, screaming pointlessly. Definitely nothing enjoyable about this film. Waste of my evening. TRASH at its trashiest. Only one actor with any talent, Igor, everyone else was ridiculous, especially the actress who could say one word \"mother-fkr\" No acting skills whatsoever, just a screaming ranting woman, angry at her own stupidity.

    "review": "For the entirety of the film, Anora is a formidable force. She manages to push back against henchmen sent to annul her marriage. Stand up against the mother of her husband. And fought a rival stripper who wished to steal him. However, this was obviously all for naught. Because Vanya, the rich boy who whisked her away from the strip club and married her, was a spoiled brat who cannot disobey his mother. The lavish montage of their fairy tale relationship transforms back into a dragging sequence in the lens of ordinary folk. The atmosphere itself is a painful contrast of two drastically different lifestyles. Mikey Madison has played expressively bratty and na√Øve characters. But Anora is an entirely different beast. She guides the narrative from dancing in non-existent clothing, to youthful romance, to slapstick and ever hinting tragedy. She can also pack a punch, solidifying Anora as a woman who refuses to back down. Yet in the final moments, when a character offered genuine human kindness to her, she was moved. This is possibly the first time Anora was offered compassion outside her services, and she was likely confused on how to reciprocate. When the first thing she can think of as gratitude was to offer her body ‚Äì she became devastated, broke down and cried. Additionally overwhelmed by the fact that this entire time, she never gave herself a chance to be vulnerable, and it all cascaded like a waterfall. Director Sean Baker and Madison are smart to decline further elaboration on this scene in interviews, as it will be the crux of every commentary about the film for good reason. We were honestly surprised when Anora won best picture at the Oscars. But in retrospect, most can pinpoint the exact moment it became an elevated experience. The class commentary hiding behind an adult romcom is a nice touch."

Based on a story that evokes nothing in the form of humor (billed as a comedy) or romance (billed as a Cinderella story)? It's not even agitating enough to discuss because the film has no heart and soul. It has a greedy girl who sees her escape out of the \"business\" and runs into a brick wall. She gets what she deserves and cries at the end. I was moved to my best BM of the week. If this is inspiration, I'm not buying into it. Hopefully, the inspired are the ones who just want to get out of the prostitution business and make good lives for themselves. My guess is, however, the 17- and 18-year-olds of this world will see Anora as an advertisement for selling their bodies with hopes of luring a drunken, stupid Nepo-dude into faux matrimony."

There is no redemption, no growth, just an attempt to use a body to achieve the american (???) dream. Well executed movie in all his parts however i cannot see a masterpiece in it. For me masterpieces are from Kubrick cinema, hitchcock and so on. A masterpiece its almost a unique think like alien, blade runner or shawshank redemptions. In american and world cinematography anora is, by far, not one and doesn't pretend to be, maybe it winks at it? Also its not a comedy movie as stated, it plays on making a comedy out of tragedy but if you keep in mind the tragedy thats behind it and that is clear in almost every part of it it becomes hardly laughable. There are hints here and there to metaphores and symbolism as it should be in every good movie but, honestly, nothing exceptional. Maybe in this age and time we are so used to mediocrity that good has become the new masterpiece of movies and masterpieces are simply out of our reach although I must argue that we have had some masterpieces, low budget of course, in the horror genre and almost one or two in the dramatic genre."

I found my antipathy peaking about mid film but was looking forward to the inevitable conclusion. It very much underwhelmed me, though Yura Borisov as Igor really got the best lines of the coda. I found the film to be only mildly entertaining, mostly because there was no sympathy for the devil here, played fiendishly well by Mark Eydelshteyn. Adding the language and culture barrier makes Anora's decisions even more ridiculous. This movie taught me very little, only mildly entertained me and quite frankly, isn't Cinderella-- it's Sid and Nancy but less interesting."

The whole first part of the movie was this \"great\" actress saying f*ck every other word, chewing gum and vaping.Oh yeah, and having sex. She starts hanging around with a rich Russian who acts like a toddler. They get married in Vegas. Why? In doesn't get good until the Russian henchmen that work for the kid's father start looking for him to annul their marriage. Just skip to the last third part of the movie. It had a great ending mostly thanks to one of the henchman falling for her. He expressed so much with his eyes, no dialogue was needed. Can't believe this won best picture. Who are they paying?"

    "review": "This review contains spoilers. Essentially, this is a Cinderella story, but not watered down. We are generally given a version of Cinderella where the prince chooses the poor girl. The movie explicitly references this fairytale, and we can see the movie as having two parts. The first part is Cinderella playing the part of the prince‚Äôs wife, and part two is watching the whole farce implode. The concept here is pretty clear: What if Cinderella were placed in a real world context? What are her actual chances of escaping poverty? There are moments where you find yourself laughing, but really you want to cry for this poor girl much of the time. It‚Äôs interesting trying to read reviews from people who didn‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs clear that this is a high brow art film. An art film that is willing to laugh at itself. Even though this movie reads as a drama about poverty, people without a bachelors degree will probably walk away scratching their heads. Because this film drew a lot of hype, a surprisingly large number of people that have no interest in this type of film tried to watch it and didn‚Äôt get it. There is something funny about the fact that movies about poverty are frequently made for the upper-middle class. This is an observation and not a criticism. The rich are not depicted in a favorable light. They are careless and heartless. Igor ends up being the savior in the film, and he is tragically not a Prince Charming. That is the tragedy. It‚Äôs why the film works for the arthouse crowd. It worked for me, but I wouldn‚Äôt watch it if you don‚Äôt like to overthink your films, despite it having a lot of lighthearted moments. TLDR; if you are into art films about poverty, this is for you. If you are trying to watch it because of the ‚Äúhype,‚Äù you will be very confused and find it boring."

The most entertaining thing about her performance was listening to her accent come and go at random. The male actor who plays Ivan is believable at times, but comical as well. It's no wonder they spent so much money on the marketing campaign for this movie, because the budget is nowhere to be seen in the actual quality of the film.

It somehow manages to be more misguided and glib than you could possibly expect. Anora simultaneously manages to degrade women and the Oscars ceremony as a whole (they spent more than the film's budget on \"an award campaign...\") and utterly hoodwink myriad esteemed critics with a sleazy trick and a self-fulfilling prophecy: it's going for Best Picture."

Of course things flip when the family finds out, and the immaturity of the kid shows. I liked how the Armenians working for the Russian family weren't super tough and scary like you'd imagine.

The second half is repeated scenes of them looking for the boy at different locations. That's most of the movie. It's not clear if the Russians are supposed to be goofy or scary, so they are neither. Lazy writing with terrible and boring dialogues. It ends as everyone says it would with no twists. No characters experience any personal growth or ever act in an unexpected way. It is a rip-off of \"Pretty Woman,\" except the main characters don't have any aspects to their personalities; the rich boy only acts as a rich boy, and the prostitute only acts as a prostitute, and they do not manage to form any meaningful connections.

    "review": "Yeah. I don't understand the super negative reviews. At its rare worst, ANORA can be a tad clunky, for instance one might complain about the pacing during the hostage scene in the home. Otherwise, sorry to say it is a great movie. When's the last time a story was actually funny, sometimes hilarious while maintaining its authenticity? Sean Baker pulled a cinematic coup. I'm assuming in addition to his editing and directorial skills, he was the main chief of casting, which was nothing short of incredible. Take for example the minor roles, like the jubilant Vegas justice of the peace, the scattered annulment cleric, the sex workers who are pretty much just doing a job that really sucks, so to speak. The casting was truly flawless. I saw the Oscars before I saw the movie and wondered, \"He won Best Editing for Anora?\" Editing sets the tone and pace and it was beautiful. I could go on and on, but suffice to say, from beginning to end, it's as close to a perfect film as one can expect. I can't imagine what else you need unless it's simply you must have a superhero saving the day? Lastly, ANORA has perhaps the most beautiful, original, modern take on a Happily-Ever-After ending in quite some time. Sean Baker's got his masterpiece. Hope to see more."

Doom is afoot; The parents are coming. Chapter 3 is a piece-by-piece fight over every scrap of the fantasy, only to find out that each of the pieces is just an illusion. It became evident early on how this one was going to end, partly because I saw who was nominated for best acting. I consider a 3.5 story movie to be a great film. But I consider a 4 star film a classic. This movie was a 3.5 star film until the very final moment when it did indeed surprise me with more sensitivity than I expected up to that point. I give it 4 stars. A classic. I will have to watch the other nominees to see if this truly was the best film of the year."

To write, direct, edit, and cast this project is astounding. On top of it, for an Indie Film with little budget to win the biggest award at Cannes and from the Academy says so much. Art is supposed to make you uncomfortable. To put yourself in others shoes. This movie does not glorify sex work but showcases it in a light for others to understand. I believe the dramatic structure of this film is excellent. I do agree that more backstory on Ani‚Äôs personal life could have strengthened our understanding of her decisions in this film, but I was still captivated the entire time. I also argue that Sean does a great job at leaving a lot up to our imagination while not having loopholes on the story. The end ties everything back to the themes of class disparity and exploitation.

Existential survival and reasons for existence seems to be sidelined as a film issue because we are bombarded with decadence and vapidness of constant self distractions. Sex, drugs, smoking, money, clubs, -all become mechanical- how empty can a life be? The best part was the last second of the film when Ani cries and gets a hug from the Russian big guy. The hidden lives don't seem to matter and the hug becomes a desperate 'peep' of a small gesture of humanity. Does it matter? Not really as I am left with the notion of,- I am glad I am not them."

After they get married, we are also introduced to the violent and aggressive people who enable his behavior: his oligarch parents (particularly his cutthroat mother) and the people they hire. The latter include an Armenian priest (or some other religious leader) who doubles as the head of the violent minders/bodyguards hired to mind the young Russian.

    "review": "Just like how Frances McDormand pleaded us moviegoers to check out ‚ÄúNomadland‚Äù on the largest screen upon winning Best Picture, writer-director Sean Baker ultimately addressed similar sentiments with utter passion when winning the honors given to his film ‚ÄúAnora‚Äù. Admittedly, there was initial disinterest when romantically marketed generically ‚Äì then picking up pessimism from reading the plot after hearing about the evocative ending. However, once intrigued by instilling dedicative passion surrounding the film‚Äôs final lap in closing the awards season, the worth is palpable, and upon seeing it not only certified that but also gladly distinguishing the entertainment value being better than what was thought prior. Claimed as a Cinderella story akin to reversing ‚ÄúPretty Woman‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnora‚Äù follows the eponymously named Ani‚Äôs (Mikey Madison) brass outlook taking a strong stance in defying reality checks beyond her sex worker profession. One night upend her life into a committed romance with Vanya (Mark Eydelshteyn), the impetuous son of a Russian billionaire looking to escape his parental controls. How they met is per his request of someone fluent with his native tongue, and Ani fits the bill that leads their frolicking communication into a romance they think qualifies true love, therefore impulsively marrying in Vegas. Vanya‚Äôs strict parents caught word of his latest actions, sending his godfather and henchmen to annul the marriage before the parents‚Äô pending arrival. But when confronted then escalated, Vanya runs and ditches Ani who much cooperate with the henchmen ‚Äì unfortunate for either party ‚Äì as they go on a wild goose chase throughout New York. The first act visually feeds in discomfort towards objectifications but arguably serves as expositional emphasis as a rational defense once the plot departs entertainingly. Baker is renowned for his authentic integrity with intimate access onto personal emotions that emits to solidify resonance, but what he envisions here first is through invasive lens that provoked two different yet similar thoughts between disbelief and questioning in regretting on seeing this. Bold yet sexy at the immediate point of blindsiding the formally prepped enjoyment in what a film could offer, and the established first impression is nowhere near that level when rather elsewhere in its own mindset. But later when looking back once the plot progresses, there is actual purpose when sympathetically emphasizes the neon-lighted profession that energizes sex workers, taken further within the underlying subtexts from observing Ani‚Äôs arc. The film may seem romantic in frontal terms, but it is actually a dramedy, yet Baker sneakily ponders the question of ‚Äúwhat is love‚Äù. You see, Ani and Vanya‚Äôs romance is nothing but physical love. We see Vanya for who he truly is according to his godfather Toros (Karren Karagulian), who actually speaks the truth with eased caution, and the absentee‚Äôs actions for the story‚Äôs remainder convincingly sends Ani towards doubt. Even so, Ani is willing to defend their marriage because she believes it expressively establishes their true love. The genre itself portrayed many varieties of the affective rules as it shows in the contrasting chemistries Ani shares willingly with Vanya and unwillingly with Igor (Yura Borisov), one of the two henchmen who seems new to the job looking after the rich brat. Igor‚Äôs gestures are innocent and more genuine like a mature, empathetic gentleman, then we see their shared conclusion for his mannerism to be met with Ani‚Äôs defensive cynicism. Their blossoming chemistry, once the amusing chaotic frustrations ended, is a pure testament to the love Ani can only understand outside of the profession‚Äôs little exposure when sensitivity is the string that the job forbids outside physical, objectifying enjoyment. After the touching, meaningful moment at the end, Ani‚Äôs inner conflict overwhelms simultaneously at the silent realization, patching the heart with grieving patience. It was not until the second act ‚Äì when Toros and his henchmen confrontationally trigger Vanya‚Äôs cowardice to verify and forcibly annul the marriage ‚Äì when the film starts presenting all that narrative brilliance as hilarity unexpectedly ensues. Before, through the first act, there was extravagant energy well captured by Drew Daniels‚Äô positional cinematography on an interactive level‚Äôs collective sensation that puts the pair into a spiral influence. Now the vibrancy spikes hysterically in the second act, therefore easing the viewing with evoked laughs being smartly edited by Baker‚Äôs sharpening vision with a true humorous sense. It also makes the justifiable drama more engaging as it thoughtfully steepens, thus debunking the pessimistic impression and enjoying how it climatically unfolds with piercing honesty that satisfies over boiling disgust. A chaotic screenplay that eventfully overlaps in hectic scenery with stellar deliverance from the cast‚Äôs astoundingly collective, breathless escalation. Notably, Eydelshteyn as Vanya energetically looks for trouble with occasionally reactive amusement, but the most outstanding obviously goes to Madison‚Äôs more stirring breakthrough as she casually mustered impeccable strength that carries the tonal narration plus embodying bold reverence in the characterized approach. Though both instilled intolerable momentum on few occasions with lowbrow meets, Madison‚Äôs performance here is memorably a force to be reckoned with. Baker‚Äôs integrity demonstratively peaks as his artistic testament and stirs under full creative command with exceptional results that nicely exceed expectations. A definite independent film that minimalizes without the aesthetic need to go the extra mile like most would when it is skillfully written with a solid mindset and nuanced characterization that deepens the storytelling process. But if decidedly gone to see ‚ÄúAnora‚Äù before its honorable win as Best Picture, which was neck-and-neck with ‚ÄúThe Brutalist‚Äù, there would not be further consideration over its stance adjacent to what its competition contextually expresses. Discussing how it deserves such honor remains debatable over the shared aspects between the two, with humane resonance as the key point and the other being classical while this one being more modern with worthwhile excellence and humbling redemption for the problematic portions.

The first 20 minutes of the film are a bit disorienting as you try to figure out the direction it is going. Anora (the main character) is a Brooklyn prostitute who meets the son of a Russian oligarch. At first, it seems like it could be a modern Cinderella story, but then the film takes an unexpected 180-degree turn. Anora is one of the most intense, funniest, and emotional films I have seen in years. It is a must-see."

I had very high expectations for the film after what I read about it and what was being said about the film that I thought I'm going to see potentially the best film of the year. But sadly, it didn't turn out like I wanted it to be or like I was hoping it to be. The first act of the film is great, the third act (after they find Ivan) is also good but not as good as the first act. But it's the second act that made me like the film less and less. The second act just loses all the power the first act established. From the second Ivan escapes the house till they find him is where I lost all interest in the film. It's pure chaos, dual-dialogues, triple-dialogues even sequences where 4 or more characters are screaming over each other. I didn't know where to look, who to hear. It really just became pure chaos. Maybe that's Baker's intention in the second act but I was not expecting this from the film at all. That's why I think I didn't like it much. I wasn't exploring the theme of the film anymore rather finding what the tone of the film is really like. Does it want to be a comedy film, a film that explores sex workers, a film about partners hiding things from each other. I didn't know anymore. I won't lie, most of the time I was laughing at some great sequences. But the problem is that those sequences are great as a single sequence but doesn't work much in the unity of the film. I don't know if on a rewatch I'll like it more or hate it more. I don't even know if I'll give it a rewatch but I think (till now) that I'll give it another chance before the Oscars season begin because I'm sure it will take home some Oscars this year. Mikey Madison gives a powerful, emotionally packed performance that maybe will land her an Oscar nomination and why not the win. Mark Eydelshteyn gives a good performance too but I had issues connecting with his childish, annoying character. Alongside Mikey Madison, my favorite character was Igor played by Yura Borisov. There was a great chemistry between him and Madison that I'm sure many people wanted them to end up together. But at the end, Sean Baker reminds us that this isn't a Disney story or some sort of fairytale and slaps us with a realistic ending that broke my heart. Overall it is a good film but I was expecting much more, or maybe the correct term that I should use is I was expecting another turn and atmosphere from the film completely that made me search for the tone of the film rather than the themes of the film."

The story could have been told in half the time with practically every scene in the middle being repeated over and over and over again. And yet, in that whole time, we learn nothing about the characters. Maybe this was by design, but I found it hard to care in the slightest about Ani. The end was predictable... sad, but predictable.

From the time they started searching for ‚Äúhim,‚Äù I already knew something was off. Ani‚Äôs very much in denial of this, and you can see that she‚Äôs very determined to have the love/life she thought was already hers. As I expected, it‚Äôs just too good to be true, and I really feel bad for her; I was rooting for her. And that ending is the epiphany of it all. I was blown away by Mikey‚Äôs portrayal. This is the second film I‚Äôve seen her in; her first as the lead, and I can say that she really brings Anora‚Äôs character to life. The on-screen chemistry she has with Mark is also refreshing. I laughed throughout the film. Igor is also another highlight, played by Yuriy. The tension between him and Annie is so strong that you‚Äôll just know something‚Äôs about to happen. This is one of the films that I can say has a great cast. Everyone brings something to the table and shines during their screen time. This is my first film from Sean Baker, and I‚Äôm excited to watch more from him."

The first part (manic ultra-rich party life) is good; the second half - the night time tour of seedy night spots in Brighton beach - even better. Great characterization and sense of place. The writing and acting is smart and spot-on in three languages. It is a physical/slapstick/screwball-type comedy - there's no intricate plot or deep character development. It is antic/frenetic - sometimes three conversations going on at the same time (often yelling). And this is not something to watch with kids or parents (there is a lot of nudity and explicit sex)."

    "review": "First impression as a Russian - wow, finally! Americans can actually hire Russian actors so we can enjoy real Russian language and not some kind of parody (like in John Week). And it makes this film REALLY unique! You do not see Russian and English abusive language interspersed often, it is so amusing (for Russian speakers, of course) What is more, actors are actually did a great job, their play allows you completely immerse in that conflict. For instance, after Garnik was punched I was so pity for him because he looks like he actually had some kind of brain injury. Another example is Ivan ‚Äî the character is a son of a rich and powerful Russian boss and Mark Eydelshteyn seemed to me so true, it is the way I imagined those rich teenagers ‚Äî endless addictions and idiotic face without any indication of brain inside, so true! Talking about the story ‚Äî I see here the story of Anora in the first place, her life and, to me, completely misunderstanding about was going on. Despite the fact that she is, without a doubt, a prostitute, she is so naive about relationships with Ivan... Though, by the end of the film you believe her growing up. Also I liked the way they showed contrast between all that parties in the beginning and something that reminds me Russian spring - depressive, wordless and with a drop of warming intimacy snowy New York in the end. In addition, I can see opposition between rich family (Zakharovs) and all their servants (Ani, Toros, Garnik), who suffer from their attitude. Like strong and weak. I suppose Igor in that story is kind of hero, because he is sorry for Ani (so typical role for Yura Borisov). I heard an opinion that Russians shown here as bad people, but I think that this story is not about nations, but more about powerful families like Zakharovs who can do what they want. Finally, I want to highlight that this film is beatiful, especially closer to the end. Colourful Brighton beach along with professional shooting makes some of the scene quite enjoyable. My beloved ones are night Brighton beach, especially that situation with tow truck driver and, of course, this extremely mesmerising snow scenes in the end... With Yura Borisov in the frame it seems very Russia-like. Great to watch, not sure about rewatch. And thanks for normal Russian!!!"

The story itself was interesting but comparing it to a \"present day Cinderella story\" is beyond belief. Although I enjoyed the Anora character and felt her pain, she and Vanya were poth light and superficial characters. Vanya was pathetic. The emptiness of the storyline only made it worth something when the three-stooges-like crazy comedy was thrown in, which seemed superfluous and only for attention. The ending was nice, but then, where did it go? Everything about the movie was a cop-out to me. Using sex -and tons of it- as a way to get attention and then not saying much. the ending was \"almost poignant\" then too not saying much, which the movie, if it was going to be any good, needed. Why the Academy Award Committee would resort to honoring their coveted \"Best Movie\" Award to this rat-trap is beyond me. What does this say to our others? Not much but sex in our face and then making crazy comedy about it. A sex Worker's life it sad and limited, I feel this movie exploited the profession and women in this case. Again, an Academy Award winner should be powerful, unique, important, well-done, poignant, innovative and this was empty."

There is no fulfilling story line. The characters are fairly well developed, and Mikey Madison does a great job as her first film, but best actress?? And the charactor of Igor is like you expect him to be some satisfying reality, and he's not. I never understand why prostitutes are such great film fare as some lost souls seeking some redemption or hope. Bill Maher pointed out almost 80 actors playing prostitutes have won best actor, or were nominated.

It‚Äôs not a bad movie, but the expectations and accolades given to this movie (along with the absurdly high rotten tomatoes scores from both the audience and the critics) make it deserving of a 1 star rating. Best original screenplay??? This is Cinderella, Risky Business, and Pretty Woman wrapped into one, made Russian, and multiplied the sex scenes by 10. The acting was above average, the shots and editing were decent, but there was zero emotional payoff or character growth. Half of the movie was a macguffin to find a worthless Russian brat, and the other half was solicited sex and drugs. Not only this, but any depth this movie chose to show was at the very end when Anora finally broke down on Igor‚Äôs lap after she recognized how poorly her life, life choices, and coping mechanisms are. Furthermore, I thought the sex scenes were grotesque and meaningless. I think the audience understands what strippers or prostitutes do for money, and what the acts look like, so showing us 15 different sex scenes within 2 hours does not suddenly make this movie an expos√© on the trials and tribulations of women who turn to sex work out of desperation, curiosity, or lack of education and opportunity. Despite this clear overemphasis and over-sexualization of Anora, there was very little emphasis on the financial, transactional, and dehumanizing aspect of stripping and sex work, making it both highly unrealistic and lacking true empathy toward the woman whose whole life was upended. Even more unbelievable was the approach the Russian mobsters took to annulling Anora‚Äôs marriage. One would think these goons would be more than happy to ‚Äúphysically compel‚Äù Anora to annul the marriage instead of run around like idiots all movie. All in all, I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with this movie, but Hollywood as a whole as well. The critics‚Äô standards, writing, directing, acting, and production of these movies are the worst they‚Äôve been for my entire life, to the point I‚Äôm questioning whether these Rotten Tomatoes reviews or if Hollywood has paid critics and made bot accounts to inflate reviews of these Oscar-Winning movies. This movie isn‚Äôt worth watching, and hopefully Hollywood course-corrects, because I just can‚Äôt bring myself to continue watching bad movies and fill the pockets of the out-of-touch, incomprehensibly wealthy, lizard people of Los Angeles.

An audacious and narrative, Anora won‚Äôt be for everyone - it is bound to upset some, but that is to be expected with the polarizing subject matter. However, there is no denying the filmmaking abilities of Sean Baker and the radiant talent of Mikey Madison."

Other than the sexy beginning the movies true theme starts slowly, then takes off. Some smiles, some laughs, then funny, with the incompetent attempts at violence. The movie's end can be seen in a couple scenes, but is a good ending to a web of moves. Worth the ratings it has received."

That apart, the story is utterly original; the comic scenes (and the Russian accents‚Äîand instances of ‚Äúblyat!‚Äù throughout) are gut-bustingly funny; the performances are superb‚Äîand all the real emotion (even sentimentality, yes) is hidden beneath the surface, if you will. An absolute must-watch!"

The whole movie is a decent into hell. I don‚Äôt mind cursing, but the whole dialogue is filled with the f bomb. The movie is a ‚Äúroot canal with no novocaine‚Äù."

    "review": "I'm curious what was it about this movie that won all those oscars, aside from the overt sex scenes. I was hoping that the nudity wasnt the ONLY thing but after watching it I really can't pin down what was \"Best\" about this movie. The storyline we've seen before; it's basic - A stripper performs for a billionaire's son, he ask her to be his gf for a week, pays her as an escort, they get married in vegas, and his family annuls the marriage because of her shameful career. ....and that was it. There was no plot twist, nothing spectacular, no performance was a standout. It was NOT a comedy, it was a drama with a handful of laughable moments. And despite sean bakers plea to make films for the big screen, this is easily a \"wait till it hits streaming\" film. You dont need a floor to ceiling screen or surround sound for the partying, fighting, or sex scenes. Mikey beating out Demi and Cynthia with this performance, had my expectations super high. But I left the theater deeply underwhelmed. The movie ended strangely, part of me thought the way it ended was unnecessary and couldve been a redeeming character development moment for Anora (& igor) but it went left quick. If you're curious to see it in theaters do it on a Tuesday so you don't have to pay full price."

There may be a few jokes here and there but it‚Äôs nowhere near a comedy, it‚Äôs a heavy drama. The tone changes quickly for the second act, and although there‚Äôs scenarios presented that should create tension I found the last half of the movie dragged out and difficult to sit through."
