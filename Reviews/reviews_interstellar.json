This breathtaking film, anchored by a mesmerizing performance from Matthew McConaughey, transcends the boundaries of space and time, urging viewers to ponder the vastness of the universe and the profound beauty of life. It‚Äôs a story that stirs the soul, leaving you in awe of both human connection and the wonders that lie beyond our world. As the film poignantly reminds us, ‚ÄúLove is the one thing we are capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space.‚Äù Genuinely the greatest movie ever made, with a soundtrack that is nothing short of perfection."

      "review": "Interstellar is another movie where Christopher Nolan hits the ball out of the park. Between the absolute beauty that is the music by Hans Zimmer, and the absolute top-tier acting performance that Matthew McConaughey delivers (especially those yells and cries my god), it is a must-watch for any fan of space exploration. Christopher Nolan's Sci-fi adventure is also surprisingly more science than fiction. The way he uses no sound when you're looking at the movie from space is peak genius. My only real negative is that the movie's length is a bit tedious, and while watching it the first hour is definitely the hardest to get through due to massive exposition dumps. But when you finish the movie, it does feel very complete and everything comes full circle. The pacing is near exceptional, however, do pay attention to details the movie drops because like my algebra class, this story flies like a rocket. Now onto spoiler territory, the concept of wormholes and time dilation is stellar, not pun intended. The way Cooper just sacrifices himself by going into the tesseract felt like the scene was shooting bullets at my heart. And the pure emotion Matthew McConaughey is putting into his voice when he's telling Murphy to stay could make the toughest grown men cry, I'm sure of it. Overall, if you're looking for an emotional space movie, and you're willing to sit through nearly 3 hours of adventure, Interstellar is the perfect watch."

I have seen this film several times before watching it in theaters but let me just say it is an indescribable feeling getting the chance to watch this in the theater, in IMAX nonetheless. I truly felt transported. Interstellar pushes our views as well as our thoughts beyond time and space and out as far as other dimensions. It allows us to go beyond the limit of our knowledge regarding space and time and travelling through them and to think deeper than just what is on our own planet. You just have to be willing to look up at the sky and wander and be willing to explore."

No amount of awards could amount to how beautiful and psychologically powerful this film is. I don‚Äôt think there couldn‚Äôt ever be a movie as aspiring and deep as this one. I cried so many times, bawling my eyes out, snot everywhere because my I couldn‚Äôt handle the emotions this movie brought me. There so much I want to stay about this movie but nothing amount of words can get my point across of how much this movie changed me and my perspective on life and humanity itself. The idea of time has always been fascinating to me and now I feel so overwhelmed with curiosity over the matter that I don‚Äôt know what to do. A movie has never left me in such shambles as this has. I seriously can not stress it enough that it is the greatest film masterpiece of all time and I dearly hope every generation can come to appreciate this movie no matter how the world ends. I don‚Äôt know what will happen in the near future of even thousands of years into the future. Maybe life will become what this movie is? Whatever what life may become, I hope that life continues to live, through all the turmoil and the pain, the unknown, the fear, everything.

      "review": "Let me get this straight-this movie is a cinematic MASTERPIECE. The story, the music and score, the acting...everything is SO WELL DONE. In my personal opinion Matthew McConaughey completely carried this movie. He delivered such a remarkable and jaw dropping performance that left me speechless at the end. Are we even going to talk about the scene where he watches the videos from his kids?! I was in awe-and honestly a little unsettled-the whole scene because of how real his performance felt, as if he truly was a father mourning the lost years of his kids' lives, like Cooper. The way he could tap into such raw emotion, make himself cry, and deliver such an eerily authentic portrayal was almost frightening in its realism. He also had such a great onscreen bond with Mckenzie Foy that even left me in tears as we watched their relationship and bond unfold and eventually save humanity. There were many aha! Moments and the adrenaline was indeed pumping as I was mesmerized and pulled deeply into concentration on the movie. So why is this movie missing two stars? Don't get me wrong Christopher Nolan completely delivered and made me feel all the emotions he wanted viewers to feel, and while I did enjoy it, it is not a movie to take lightly. There is a lot of informational thrown at you and a lot of words the average movie watcher might not understand. I get it, it's a sci-fi movie, and a great one at that, but the end completely messed with my brain and had me scavaging the internet and Youtube for explanations. Because of this, I feel like this movie is one that you really can't talk to your friends while watching or get up to go to the bathroom since you will miss critical information. Also, there were some scenes and monologues that felt a little too long and didn't do much to drive the story forward. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Interstellar. It's an incredibly captivating and emotional film that kept me hooked from start to finish. While it can be a bit confusing at times and definitely a lot to take in, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who loves thought-provoking, visually stunning movies."

I think people either love it or find it a bit confusing. I needed to watch it twice to understand it. This movie is a must watch and I recommend it to everyone! It also reminds me of a song - Space Song by Beach House."

The vision of this movie is big and the visual effects are even bigger, so see this on a giant home Screen or commercial theatre with big sound too. There's a human story, too, and a father and daughter promise that holds the emotional core of the story together with all the mind-bending science stuff happening. And fun visual rides happen here. Ever wonder what traveling through an actual space wormhole would look like? There are tiny flaws in the characterization in the editing of the final version, but really with a story this ambitious and heroic, who wants to quibble on that front? Finally, the whole family can see this."

It could have been an incredible masterpiece, delving heavily into explaining in layman‚Äòs terms the idea of time and space and higher quantum physics, but unfortunately, it also wanted to appeal to a really ignorant audience that just wants to see some stars running around perhaps going to be in love or perhaps angry with each other etc. Also, it‚Äôs always nice to have a few drama scenes with gizmos and gadgets and funny little robot beings. Stupid people like this. In the end, Nolan didn‚Äôt really know which direction he was going in, and I think he shoved in as much physics stuff as he could at the end movie which is what I believe He really wanted to make -which was an intelligent film about the fifth dimension or whatever - so he shoved it all roughly in in the last hour or so of the flic. He then tied it all together with an emotional ending with Matthew McConaughey meeting his old, almost dead daughter. It‚Äôs somewhat worth a watch and I would recommend it for anyone trying to have some fun with the elaborate ideas of what we are attempting to strive for as a human species, but I wouldn‚Äôt be upset with them if they decided they didn‚Äôt want to watch it because you‚Äôre not really gonna learn anything New. An admirable Attempt but alas a mediocre one."

If the movie maybe limited itself to 2-3 issues with science talk, It would have been better.

Since then I have seen the movie probably about 13 times, and feel what most captivated me the most about this movie was the yes, the visuals and acting, but what captured me the most was the music. The music in the movie is absolutely remarkable and I want to thank Hans Zimmer for making me want to learn to play the main theme and to learn how to play the piano in the first place. Recently I played it for my school talent show and received a standing ovation. Thank Hans Zimmer and thank you Christopher Nolen."

I love new films, but I've always known and believed that oldies are where it's at, or was, and that nothing will ever come close. But I can say now, after watching this movie, I understand what THEY (pun intended) were talking about. I love movies, and I've watched so very many, but I promise you, this one is touching. It'll make you laugh, and it it'll definitely make you cry.

      "review": "I‚Äôve spent a full decade anticipating the return of Interstellar to the big screen in its purest form‚Äî70mm IMAX‚Äîand let me say, it surpassed every grand expectation I carried with me. There‚Äôs something profoundly immersive about watching Christopher Nolan‚Äôs vision unfold in that large-format glory, where every star and ripple in space feels tactile and alive. This isn‚Äôt just a sci-fi movie it‚Äôs a soul-stirring journey through the best and worst of humanity, a meditation on love, time, sacrifice, and hope. After all these years, the visuals still hold an unmatched sense of wonder. Seeing the iconic scenes‚Äîlike the spaceship poised delicately against Saturn‚Äôs rings, or the breathtaking approach to Gargantua‚Äîon an enormous screen made me catch my breath as if I were an explorer staring into the unknown. But it wasn‚Äôt just the cinematic spectacle that struck me it was the surge of emotions that washed over me again and again. From the exhilaration of liftoff to the anxiety of clock-ticking planetary landings, from the heartache of impossible choices to the awe of cosmic revelations, my emotions soared and crashed like waves on a distant shore. In particular, the relationships at the film‚Äôs core struck a deeper chord this time around. The dialogue between Cooper and Murph felt even more resonant, the idea of love transcending time and space richer than ever. By the time the credits rolled, I was left overwhelmed‚Äîgrateful that this story had returned in such pristine quality, astonished by how it still moved me to tears, and comforted by the timeless human truths it illuminates. It took me a decade to see Interstellar again this way, and it was worth every second of that wait. This re-release stands as a reminder that truly great cinema doesn‚Äôt just entertain it shakes you to your core. If you have the chance to witness it in 70mm IMAX, don‚Äôt hesitate. This is a film that will remind you why you fell in love with the magic of movies in the first place."

The visuals are incredible and the auditory experience is just insane and FUN. The sheer loudness of everything, but then the way it can transition from the loudest rocket booster boom to the void of deep space. The contrast is amazing and in concert with the visuals, gave me chills every time. And the bass, the earth shattering low end my god. Felt like the whole room was going to fall apart.
