    "review": "Unless you're a die-hard fan, you won't recognize these characters, but what you will recognize is people dealing with trauma. I deeply enjoyed this film as a long-time Marvel fan along with my wife (who has zero knowledge of this stuff) because the themes are relatable. Each character deals with grief, irrelevance, regret, disappointment, and loss in a way that resonates with the audience. I read some really harsh reviews, but I actually enjoyed the film a lot more than I thought I would. It's not a perfect film, by any means. However, it does keep a really tight grip on the plot and doesn't muddy the waters too much with the ensemble cast, instead (wisely) choosing to focus on the three main leads. Their arcs are compelling, emotional, and real. I do wish that some of the characters had more time to bond and that some of the plot devices weren't so obvious (such as visible countdown timers for traps and easily located bomb power supplies), but they don't detract from the emotional beats. I liked that they take their name from Yelena's childhood team, the \"Thunderbolts,\" a soccer team that \"never won a game.\" Phrasing is important -- it's not that they're losers, it's just that they've never won. To date, each character is dealing with 'victories' that are either morally gray or pyrrhic, so they all feel like underachievers. As underdogs, it's hard not to root for them."

Even the writers seemed to laugh at it in the movie when BSentry says, so I am better than a god...Overall I liked the Thunderbolts team but the naming of them as the New Avengers felt kind of unusual. Like what about Hulk, Ant Man, Spiderman, Dr Strange...Are they out? What about Captain Marvel, or Thor? Overall it was fine, better than the new Captain America but not a favorite."

I really enjoyed it even though the only character I really liked going into the movie was Bucky. At the end I like all of the characters more now and story and the action was actually really cool. Not sure if I liked it so much because of how disappointing a lot of stuff has been recently from marvel and it was a breath of fresh air. Or if it‚Äôs actually good on its own. I feel like if this released before endgame it would be lower tier but because it‚Äôs after endgame it‚Äôs definitely the best one other than Spider-Man no way home."

    "review": "I'm often a super hero movie skeptic. The worst super hero movies wind up being the all powerful hero versus the indestructible villain gallavanting through a city causing massive destruction amounting to nothing. Thunderbolts* felt like the antithesis of this. Every one of the characters was very human and very flawed. None -- even the powerful villain, was indestructible. And much of the movie actually focused on the very real issue of mental health. Multiple of the characters were grappling with mental health making them feel all that more real and human. On top of this, the writing was pretty humorous. Florence Pugh and David Harbour had the best characters, constantly throwing out witty one liners. And Julia Louis-Dreyfus was surprisingly good as Tulsi Gabbard -- I mean the evil CIA director. I never remember any of the broader plot lines from the Marvel universe and there were definitely a lot of references back to things that happened that I no longer remember from past movies. But it never felt like it mattered that I didn't remember. Overall it was a well put together, humorous movie that seemed to have a much more meaningful point than many vacuous superhero movies."

    "review": "Thunderbolts is a strong, surprisingly grounded entry in the MCU that reminds us just how good Marvel can be when it actually leans into character, humor, and tight storytelling. With a cast of familiar faces and morally gray heroes, the film strikes a great balance between gritty action and sharp wit. The acting is consistently solid across the board, with returning characters like Yelena Belova and Bucky Barnes stealing scenes with both emotional depth and comedic timing. The chemistry between the team is believable, messy, and entertaining‚Äîjust what you‚Äôd want from a group of reluctant allies. The writing is smart and refreshingly character-driven, with enough humor to keep things light without undercutting the stakes. Action sequences are punchy, well-choreographed, and serve the story rather than overwhelm it. Thunderbolts may not reinvent the genre, but it doesn't need to. It's a reminder that Marvel still knows how to deliver a fun, engaging, and well-made superhero movie when it stays focused. A solid win that earns its place in the lineup."
