    "review": "\"Twilight\" is the first installment of a popular franchise based on the novels by Stephenie Meyer. The film tells the love story between an ordinary girl, Bella Swan, and a vampire, Edward Cullen. One of the main strengths of \"Twilight\" is its atmosphere. The filming in the dark and mysterious town of Forks creates an ideal backdrop for the romantic story, and the music enhances the emotional weight. The characters also deserve attention. Kristen Stewart as Bella beautifully conveys her inner turmoil and insecurity, while Robert Pattinson as Edward creates the image of a mysterious and alluring vampire. Their chemistry on screen is palpable, making the story more engaging. However, the film has not been without criticism. Some viewers note that the plot can feel slow, and the dialogues may come across as somewhat naive. Nevertheless, \"Twilight\" found its audience and became a cult phenomenon for many fans of the genre. Overall, \"Twilight\" is a romantic drama with elements of fantasy that captivates with its atmosphere and memorable characters. The film is definitely worth watching for those who enjoy stories about forbidden love and supernatural beings."

The PNW captures the moody sullenness of a sanitized vampire romance. And the music choices hit mostly. The needle drops are upbeat, and the original themes have a soft melancholy vibe. Otherwise leave this movie for the fans, or for RiffTrax"

    "review": "Yes, I've decided to watch the \"Twilight\" series. No, I'm not crazy. I think so. After all, the series has been with me (mostly peripherally) since sixth grade. More and more school bus rides in fours with the girls from my village revolved around Meyer's books and eventually also around the films and above all around the question: Team Edward or Team Jacob? For me it was clear - Pattinson looks like a man in his late thirties with a heroin problem in this film. I'd rather take Jacob. At least he knows how to repair cars. You can always use him. Out of curiosity, I read the first book and saw at least a large part of the first film. And for some reason, at that age, I found \"Indiana Jones\", \"Saw\" and \"Final Destination\" much more interesting than the \"Twilight\" series. Because simply NOTHING happens in this two-hour film. The highlight is a baseball game and Bella's escape(?) from Forks. Over 15 years later, my cinematic vocabulary has expanded significantly. And so I actually had two hours of fun with \"Twilight\". Because everything in this film is objectively bad: the green filter, Kristen Stewart, all the other actors, the visual effects (from ILM?!), the droning of the soundtrack (Paramore fans will get their money's worth), the 'plot', the author's reactionary Mormon worldview, Robert Pattinson's made-up muscles, the dialogue, simply EVERYTHING. Every frame contains something that is not good. And this is where the trivial and low-tension plot comes into its own: you have time to laugh at all these things that you would have no muse for in a real film. In any case, I'm looking forward to part 2."

Twilight is not particularly a good movie by any means at all, however, I did enjoy this movie immensely and found it to be quite hilarious. The characters are absolutely ridiculous and the circumstances in which these people and creatures are put in, is actually quite funny a lot of times. There are many quotable moments of this film and scenes that will probably stick with me forever, but none of it exactly struck me as well-made. It was as if they marketed this movie as a serious drama as a punchline to show us that it was actually supposed to be a Rom/Com. Overall, I enjoyed it for the reasons I probably should not have, but something about the movie drew me in more and more. All I know is that I never want to be the Edward to my Bella at all."

I could not find one glitch or hitch to bash the pleasure. I have no idea how it got by me for so many years. Well done Catherine. I notice a lot of Senior Type pro reviewers bashing it. They just don't know how to watch things with a young heart. I actually had no idea what the movie was about. A great way to discover a gem. About a third of the way through I thought \"Ah, a werewolf movie!\" Nice surprise. And top marks to the screen writer also Melissa Rosenberg. Great stuff. No-one put a foot wrong in this."

The moody yet romantically tragic undertones set in the middle of Portland high school suburbia is the perfect mixture of an addictive and interesting viewing. Add in vampire and werewolf clans - we get a hit. The main leads who play Edward and Bella have amazing chemistry, making it the main recipe for its triumph. The camp and parody is real, but that's what makes it so fun and literally is the definition of the catalyst that started it all. Even though I was too young to be initially invested, the first iteration is enough to get me curious to how it will continue. Twilight's grounded start surrounding first loves, teenage angst and family ties is what we pleasantly (expectantly) got. And I'm here for it."

She thought it would be really cool if I watched the movies. It was cool for a minute. Now my motivation is to make fun of my son for watching these things. He didn't like them. On re-watch, I don't think they're very good movies and I really don't care much for the tag-team of Stewart and Pattinson. Romeo and Juliet? Hardly. But I do love to read Ebert and Fetters and other viewpoints on the movies. Ebert was especially kind to give me quotes for my letterboxd review and then threw in the name of a \"similar but better\" flick called Let the Right One In. It's Swedish and has subtitles, but it's my next watch. Look for it on Kanopy."

The film has beautiful cinematography. The musical score adds emotion and suspense. I think all of the characters are charismatic. As for the dialogue -I think awkward can be more realistic.

They fall in love, now Bella must face the adventure of the vampire. The plots seem to be absorbing because, she reveal each suspense and we reveal the characters on the people. My opinion this special effect is  astounding, during the movie we can see the speed vampire and their supernatural powers. Photography is really incredible because we can see every detail of the action of each scene appears in a different form like the   extreme long shot, the medium shot and  extreme close up shot.  My opinion this is acting and the performance is natural, convincing each actor to play your role well and Of the script and writing, the script is thought-provoking, compelling because we manage to want the sequel each chapter.

    "review": "It's a bit of a slog but its ok enough. Everything about this is just nothing special. The music is super forgettable and generic. The acting is the most unique thing about this for bettter or for worse. Everyone acts and delivers lines in a very hoaky/campy way that makes it weird but kind of not also. There is some deadpan humor in little bits that does work every now and than but for the most part there isn't much charm to speak of or humor for the most part. There is some chemistry in spurts between Bella & Edward at times but it feels muted at times because their holding back and also the hoaky acting weighs as well. I get the love is forbidden and the holding back is part of it but still. Also, the \"villians\" feel very hammed in at the last second and are super forgettable along with most of the support cast. The cinematography is super forgetful also because everything has a dull grey color tone to it. Honestly, this should've been shot in black and white and would've helped make this more moody and make things pop more because most of the settings, scenes, and camerawork is super forgettable because of how dull and grey everything is. I know thats part of the plot but you gotta make changes for a movie adaptation. The special effects match the acting at times with some hoaky wire jumping that is kind of a double edged sword. The editing remains focused on Belle 95% of the time and does tell enough of a romance and vampire tale together but very loosely. It can feel like stuff just happens to her at times but it works enough. And all this leads to a passable pacing but it can feel like a slog at times. Especially the climax which doesn't really have a lot of buildup to it and was a bit anticlimatic. Unless your nostalgic and grew up with this or are a die hard fan of Patinson or Stewart I'd say skip this. Even if your a fan of the source material I don't think there isn't anything special here."

This is something I've putting for a long time as far as I'm concerned they received bad reviews mostly down to the fact that they're badly acted, poorly written, and poorly executed. Overall these films are box office successes, yeah, but I honestly haven't seen them but now that I'm on the road to do so I'm probably going to hate them more than loving them 'cause sometimes you gotta agree what others are thinking. All right, let's get on with it. Bella Swan played by Kristen Stewart, a teenage girl, moves to Forks to live with her father, she meets her friends in her new high school and sat next to Edward Cullen played by Robert Pattinson in biology class but he seems repulsed by her. After a week's absence from school, Edward returns and meets with her. Bella nearly got struck by a van in a school parking lot and Edward saves her with his hand. And the rest is Bella and Edward having conversations with lame dialogue. Yeah, I can see where this is going. But he tells her that he can't go out when it's light because it is revealed he is a vampire all along at 17 for many, many years. So, he fell in love with Bella who doesn't care. You know what? I think this is pretty s**tty the way this is written. The dialogue, the story, and characters that I can't get invested in. It's just a downright mess for me. Okay, okay, that's enough for me on this on. On to the next one."

It showed her that true love isn't defined by regulations and borders, it doesn't matter if the other person is a werewolf, a vampire or a simple human, the only thing that matters is ones feeling towards the other. The movie is a tale of human misery and the search for something real in a world of lies, but only those who are able to put themselves into the shoes of the characters and feel their compassion towards another are able to comprehend it's true hidden message. For anyone else it might just seem like a worse than mediocre movie, but for those who know, for those who understand the true meaning behind life and the misery that comes with it, it's not only a masterpiece but a reflection of our human nature. This movie shows us what really matters in life while not being overly intrusive. Just a great movie 10/10, would recommend to anyone."

This results in a film that is intensely dull, emotionally childish, and completely lacking in any insight, even in romantic elements. Now, I was going to give this movie a 1.5 Star rating because of how dumb and dull it is, along with how terrible Robert Pattinson is (who looks like a deformed mannequin as well), but this movie did kick off the, luckily short-lived, trend of mistaking stalking with love, as well as the acceptance (if not outright glorification) of manipulative relationships. This element makes the Twilight series genuinely kinda horrific from a moral perspective, and the fact that it's pretty much left the public consciousness (having mostly existed as a lolcow during most if its time in the limelight) is really the only good thing I can say about it."

Laughed at this franchise from a distance when it was being released, figured I should finally bite the bullet and just watch it all in one go to understand the references, because Twilight was undeniably an influential piece of pop culture, for better or worse. Knowing how popular this was doesn't make it any easier to watch; nothing happens in this movie for so long, but then the 'romance' feels crazy rushed and insubstantial, full of weird flourishes that are supposed to be grand shows of dedication but are straight-up creepy. And that's ignoring the whole fact that the main relationship is pedophilic by definition, but it's all good because the 100-year-old man that watches you sleep looks like he's 17. It's kind of funny as comedy, though. All the silliness, the goofball dialogue, the weird half-parody high school dynamics, the junior high fantasy elements that don't include explicit sexuality or drinking because Stephanie Meyer chose adherence to strict Mormon tenets, and the fact that this film basically has no actual plot. A great ironic, so-bad-it's-good watch. Only four more of these to go. (1.5/5)"

    "review": "Kristen Stewart stars as Bella in this heart-felt romance/fantasy movie; she protrayes her role as Bella quite well, but it still doesn't cover the freaking fact: This Movie Sucks. As much as I didn't go in with any expectations for this movie, it still sucked -- and hard. There is some cool fantasy moments, but it's dull out by all the romance that's going on in the movie. Bella and Edward are two unique couple -- one being a vampire and the other human. I have never read the book for it, but I heard that the Twilight books were great, so instead of reading a thick novel, why not see a 2 hour movie on it. Well, I regretted watching this movie -- not exactly at once, but near the end of the movie I saw how much this movie truly sucked. How this movie was mainly leaning on the romance side to give it \"a push.\" It suffers on the great parts in the movie -- such as the fight near the end -- because it doesn't exactly feel real. There is some bloody images I was not expecting in the movie at all. The movie is somewhat interesting, but it weaves a love story instead of making it more interesting in the \"Twilight Universe.\" The characters are alright, you can say, but in reality: I though Vampires had wings and could fly/transform into bat. These kind of vampires seem like a whole different kind of race. There really isn't any antagonist except two vampires who want Bella's blood. The theme is mainly on romance and it does not promote anything that is worthy to apply/keep track in your life. As much as some girls like this movie, I hate the freaking movie -- no matter how much CGI they put in the movie."

This film has so much hate and love surrounding it that it's hard to block other people's opinions. But I will say that a lot of the hate from men, in particular, make fun of the movie because young girls like it so much which kind of rubs me the wrong way. To step away from that though this movie is so unintentionally funny. Whether you like it or not, it's still a very influential series in the early 2000s.

    "review": "I understand why everyone who hasn't read the books hates it so much. It appears to be a gushy romance film with werewolves and vampires. And it is! But for those of us who devoured the entire book series overnight, it was wonderful seeing it come to life in a movie. I believe Kristen Stewart accurately portrays how awkward and glassy-eyed Bella is, and knowing that Robbert Pattinson hated every moment of filming this somehow adds to the whole broody vibe Edward has going on. There are some parts of the story that are a bit ‚Äòehh', for example Jacob essentially falling in love with an infant while knowing that the moment she turns 18, he's gonna snatch her up. That was uncomfortable to read, and see. It would have been better if Stephanie Meyers had made Jacob clearly state that he never wanted to have any romantic relationship towards Renesme if he was going to help raise her (from birth, mind you) because that is incredibly wrong. As she matures, he will essentially be grooming her. But overall, this is my favourite book and movie series of all time. I've even re-read the books a few times because I love getting immersed in this fantastical world. I can recite the plot of every movie and I'll still watch them over and over again. As an autistic woman with ADHD, i became emotionally attached to this franchise very quickly. It's a hyperfixation and a source of comfort. I know it's very cringey but I love it so much. It's my emotional support cringe. For fans of fantasy, romance and action movies, I would recommend this, but not before reading the books. The books explain so much and show you so much more than the movies. And, as with every book to movie franchise, they changed some stuff around. I was a bit confused when I watched the movie, as to why Edward declared his love to this girl he just met and has only spoken to twice, on their first date after he just saved her from rapists; when in the books they spend a lot more time together having loads of fun and getting to know each other before he whips out the \"I feel very protective of you\" which, and let's be honest here, was a bit unexpected and a bit much. The books pace it way better, which is probably why they were such a hit. Had the movies been made first and the books written afterwards, I think the franchise popularity wouldn't be nearly as overwhelming. But overall, I adore this story. Team Edward all the way."

Making colors vibrant is a wildly underutilized cinematography decision and it makes movies like this, which may have otherwise been mediocre, stand out as among the most visually pleasing to me. It doesn't hurt that they fleshed out the cast with a bunch of attractive people, nor that I quite liked the book it was based on. I only noticed Kristen's wooden facial expressions a few times and Pattinson has the same type of absurdly perfect facial structure as Brad Pitt, where (as a boring cis white dude) I'd be happy to see him star in most of the movies I watch. The primary disappointment for me was knowing how much better Gigandet's physique had been in Never Back Down earlier in the year; he put on a seriously tremendous performance as the antagonist in that movie, far less so in this one. I'd say this edges out the rest of the series as my favorite of the lot, though there's really not a lot of difference in quality between each of them."

On a good note, Charlie, was the HIGHLIGHT of the movie (talk about a dilf!) And lets not forget Alice, the sweetest and most beautiful character in the movie. I will say, just like any forbidden love story, I fell for it quicker than my grandma falls on ice in the winter time.

The main actors are Kristen Stewart who plays the role of Bella Swan, Robert Pattinson who plays Edward Cullen and Taylor Lautner who plays the role of Jacob Black. My overall impression of this saga is who I liked, especially the story because she talks about the fantastic but she remains attached to reality through to the love that shares Bella and Edward, I also find that the last film did not a give real ending I hope there is will have a sixth. This saga tells the story of Bella Swan who is human and forms a love triangle with Edward Cullen who is a vampire and Jacob Black who is a werewolf. The actors described the key roles so as to assimilate to each actor a gift such as Edward can read minds and Jacob transform a self werewolf, Bella, she is just human at first, but at a knack for preventing others from reading her minds.Their lives have been transmitted by the does that the saga begins when the characters are adolescents, therefore in high school.The movies meet my expectations, who was who Bella would fall in love with? And also is this that she will be turned into a vampire? For me the characters were believable because I was able to immerse myself in the story completely.The roles were played so well to the point that it felt like it was a story that really happened unrolled. The films are most of the time filmed at normal angle and sometimes at tall angle, the scenes are most often shot outside which creates realism and the atmosphere is dark it creates the suspense.The breaks between scenes are relatively short, it flows at normal speed this which allows us not to be lost and not to get bored too. Actors do not really wear costumes because they are dressed because teens who go to high school are not outfits that go out either common. The messages conveyed by the saga is already a forbidden love, it is two people who love each other and everyone opposes their love at first and Bella chose love over comfortable because she chose Edward over Jacob. The second message that gets passed is anti-abortion because Bella chose to keep her child despite everything even if it must cost her her own life. I find that the messages are quite convincing because they are shown in a way that makes viewers want to take the risks like Bella for love, for example. And for the second message it is very strong so touch quite easily the viewer."

This film is the love story of a very socially awkward girl with another very socially awkward boy who happens to be a vampire, with beautiful shots and music. Don't forget that while watching it. Many people don't like it because they expect the female teenager protagonist to be a certain way, to be a role model, when it's actually not a necessity at all. There's nothing wrong with being quiet, awkward, not enthusiastic and gloomy. There's nothing wrong with enjoying this film just because of the short dialogues, the eye contact and the beautiful aesthetic ambience that the characters are involved in. Don't expect this film to be a romantic comedy with laughter and fun just because it's a female teenage film."

Following the saga of the films, Edward and Bella risk their entire family to follow their love, although it is somewhat silly to some extent, it shows that the family must always be united, like the Cullens.

Meyer, in my opinion, is a great writer, the only thing I criticize about her writing is that she uses her expression too often: \"and she rolled her eyes\".

    "review": "If you want to find some great romantic vampire movie to watch, you should watch Twilight. It was directed by Katherine Hardwick, created by Mark Morgan, Greg Mouradian and Vic Godfrey and written by Melissa Rosenberg. The movie genre is romantic, fantasy, action and thriller. The running time is 120 minutes. The actors are well-chosen because the role of characters in the movie are as same as the actors. Bella Swan and Edward Cullen are the main character. The actress who played the role of Bella is Kristen Stewart. Bella is a young girl who is courageous, clever, attractive, innocent and beautiful as same as Kristen. The actor who played the role of Edward is Robert Pattinson. Edward is a handsome vampire who is so attractive, charming, mysterious, smart, strong and also handsome as same as Robert. The emotional expressions of the characters are wonderful. They did it very well. Some scenes make me come back to realize that I had the same feeling or some scenes that perfectly relay the lives of foreign high school students, making me think of my friends and my life events during that time. I love this movie so much. The plot of this movie is interesting and penetrates the teenager well. The director nails the teenager emotions and relationships. The plot shows the sweet love affair of a human and a vampire who must work hand in hand, overcome their desires and overcome obstacles, but even though the plot is a little fanciful. Some parts of movie are unintentionally funny. For example, the scene which is Edward's facial expressions at his first whiff of Bella's intoxicating scent. I do not even know why I laughed a lot at this scene. I love the relation of the Cullen family's strong bond. It has many scenes which they try to help Bella escape the pursuit of a vampire stalker. These things reflect the love and harmony of this family very well, even though they actually came from a different family. The story's setting and position of camera is so smooth. The computer graphics are perfect and it looks real. The sound effects and music are wonderful too. This movie taught me a lot. It taught me about love, relationship, friends, family etc. You will not be disappointed if you watch this movie. I highly recommend to watch it."

When i first saw the movie i loved it but as time passed i realised what a creeperd edward is and how stupid bella is. The whole movie has this weird kind off greenish filter over it. Maybe that's because it's and older film but it's weird. The special effects look very good at times and laughable at other times. The morals are highly questionable and the characters are average. Robert Patterson i think did everything he could with the character. The actress who plays bella is very emotionless and akword the entire movie but i don't know if that's her fault or just the material she had to work with. The fightscenes are very good as well as some of the comedy they sprinkle in there. The story is very bad moral wise but i get why a lot of us loved it."

No. Are there some cringe-worthy awkward moments that go far beyond teenage awkwardness? Yes. Do I still kinda like it? Yeah... Perhaps purely because it takes me back to my \"Team Edward\" days, but there are some actual good moments too. Catherine Hardwicke manages to take the film further by cutting a lot of the fat of the book, although I did miss some of Bella's inner dialogue that explains her painfully awkward moments. Robert Pattinson takes on an impossible to live up ideal Edward admirably. The otherworldly beauty of the Pacific Northwest is also showcased perfectly through Elliot Davis's cinematography and I still love Carter Burwell's hauntingly lovely score, especially Bella's Lullaby."

So if you want an honest review on the actual content and not what you hear on social media here it is: Twilight is a movie about a girl named Bella who falls in love with a vampire named Edward. Throughout the series they go on adventures and fight other vampires in battle. A little warning for children or parents, there is a scene where the two characters (Bella and Edward) have sex and I would highly encourage that you watch it before letting your child watch it. I didn't get to watch it until I was 13 and my mother had definitely seen it before I had. This particular scene is in Twilight: Breaking Dawn part 1 but the rest of the movies there is just kissing. As far as I know there is no actual nudity but there are adult jokes and language that may not be suitable for kids. Personally I won't let my children watch the movies until they are older but that is just my parenting style. Besides that it is a great franchise so whenever you have 10 hours of free time, now you have an activity in mind lol."

I think overall it is a good movie if you are specifically into that thing but if you're not then it's just quite boring as the characters are uninteresting, Bella is nice and cares about her family but that's about it Edward is just sort of intense and always being super emo about shit and all the other characters have one facial expression each throughout this movie. The start was good as I liked that one of the people in the class made an attempt to drink some compost before being told not to by the teacher that's kinda wild. But then after that when Bella is like in danger of being killed or whatever it's quite boring because I couldn't really care less if she died, although some of the scenes like when she is in the ballet place have good tension. Also the weird vampire cgi where they get flung across the room and climb up trees and stuff just looks so stupid. So yeah terrible movie but very arousing."

I tried to read the first book a long time ago and just couldn't get into it, so I gave up about halfway. I decided to watch these movies with an open mind and I have to say this movie does have some things I did like about it. There is plenty of awful stuff too, but I do think the movie has an exciting and enjoyable final act that saves it from being a bad movie. The central problem with the movie is that the romance is so poorly handled. The two leads have minimal chemistry and feel very emotionless at times. The dialogue also isn't the best and a lot of it either was eye-rolling or just flat out unintentionally funny. While I am aware I am not the target audience of this movie, I will admit that I enjoyed some of the more action-based elements in the movie more than I expected, and for that, I was not upset that I watched it one time."

    "review": "I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs much more to say about Twilight that hasn‚Äôt already been said. It is a romance with virtually no chemistry between the two leads. I‚Äôm not sure if Kristen Stewart could properly portray romantic attraction anyways, and Taylor Lautner is somehow worse. I think Robert Pattinson is trying, but the script he is saddled with does nothing to help. There‚Äôs something gross about the whole thing if you spend any time thinking about it, considering the age difference between the characters. Also, there‚Äôs the creepy stalker aspects that play a part in their relationship, and also the horrendous example Bella is to young girls everywhere (since she lacks any value or agency in her own story.) The effects are not good, and I find the goofy jumping and speed-running of the vampires looks ridiculous. It‚Äôs almost comical how much time the characters in Twilight spend making sly references to the fact that there are vampires and werewolves in this world. In fact, no wolves show up in this movie, but they might as well have winked right at the camera when implying that some of these characters are actually wolves. In every way it feels like Stephanie Meyer, and those who adapted her book for the big screen, don‚Äôt understand how to make a good story in any genre. As a vampire movie about dangerous killers living among humans and threatening the lives of all humanity, it lacks the edge needed. We don‚Äôt even meet an actual deadly vampire until the third act, and even one of them seems to have a code of ethics that won‚Äôt allow him to just murder humans. Also, it annoys me how clueless the humans are when it comes to the fact that these creatures are living among them and a couple are murdering people indiscriminately. The film also struggles to be an authentic romance. It‚Äôs almost like the creators don‚Äôt even know how love works, because the bond between these characters feels surface level and false. They share a physical attraction, and that seems to be all. Their conversations with one another are stilted at best, and lack any emotion. I simply can‚Äôt see why Bella and Edward should ever be together, aside from the fact that he can keep her alive. In almost every way, I find Twilight to be a sub-par film that doesn‚Äôt even deserve a spot on the Hallmark Channel."

Unfortunately it was incredibly bland, boring, and busted, all the b's. It was super long and the acting was pretty tragic. Which is sad because the cast has shown their skills better in other movies but I guess they've gotten better since this, so good for them. The villains aren't even slightly interesting and the whole plot feels like the writers (I guess specifically the og books author) were just going along and making shit up that just happened to be extremely boring. I wish this is was just so terrible it's good but it's really not even fun to hate watch this. My friend actually enjoyed it when we watched it which was shocking but whatever everyone has preferences. She wanted to watch the sequels but after the first two films I couldn't stand to view the remaining of the bunch. If you want outstanding book to movie adaptations stick to the Hunger Games, Harry Potter, etc. Or even the Divergent films because at least those ones aren't boring."

Kristen Stewart provides a performance which is fine, it's often bland, but at least gives a alright attempt at a high schooler who is in love. Robert Pattinson gives a pretty good performance, it's not amazing, but not bad. The characters are not incredible, in this movie, they haven't been explored fully yet. Edward, however can come off as slightly creepy, I won't go into too much detail for those who haven't seen the movie yet. So, should you watch this movie? Yes, if you like this kind of movie then you will probably love it, if not, give it a chance, you might like it. Overall, Twilight is a decent movie which starts of this franchise."

At it's root, Twilight is a faithful adaptation of the 2005 novel by Stephenie Meyer. Under the direction of Catherine Hardwicke the film successfully expands upon the universe created by Meyer. The introduction of the main antagonists earlier in the film, along with the cinematography and score, it really helps to build the suspense. The thing that feels like it's lacking, is fails to set up the main obstacles for the rest of the series specifically the introduction of the Volturi. Although the original novel devotes an entire chapter to them, they are missing from the film. All in all, Twilight does a great job in catering to a market that the rest of the film industry seems to ignore for the most part, that being young girls."

The ending of the film confused me but I didnt know at the time that there was going to be more. I really think this entire saga was well done, so much to the point where I decided to buy the books, don't let the opinions of others cloud your judgement, give it a go, it may not be as baad as you think. great plot, fanatastic production and dialogue. it's really worth the watch, but obviously you have to watch all of the films."

    "review": "I highly recommend the books to the movie, as the only good thing I found in these movies was the werewolves, and even those weren't in the first movie. The plot is decent enough, though somewhat unoriginal overall. Unfortunately, the movie focuses mainly on Bella, who is a disgraceful example of womankind, being insanely weak, both mentally and physically. She also seems to have a panic attack every time she is too far away from Edward, or else is simply prone to constant hair-pulling, stammering, and twitching. Undecided on whether to laugh or be disgusted. When it comes to Team Edward of Team Jacob, there's a reason to no Team Bella, as I wouldn't blame any reasonable male for being with her for 5 minutes before running for high hill."

I found the romance very blah and without any passion or anything leading up to it. I can see being interested in the vampires as a whole but I see nothing fascinating about Edward Cullen. I will say that I am fairly certain Jacob will be a more believable character than Edward. The antagonist of the movie were disappointing. I always find it sad when rivals are introduced and hinted at being so powerful and no scene or back story to back it up. There were moments when Bella Swan was a almost believable character. Went a little too emo and clearly she is not. To be fair I watched it several times to ensure I wasn't missing anything. Music was great over all! I will say this as support acting goes: Nikki Reed was convincing is her role as Rosalie! I was seriously impressed with her performance. The ratings would have been higher I am certain if they had taken more time to back story and true passion for the scenes! So in all I give it 2 stars and a re watch from time to time! -Jesse-"

    "review": "A Forbidden Love \"... and so the lion fell in love with the lamb...\" The movie \"Twilight\" was first of all inspired by a book written by Stephenie Meyer and published on October 5, 2005. For her, it all started as a dream she had where she saw a normal young teenage girl with a handsome, unnatural teenage boy talking in the middle of the forest. She couldn't stop thinking about this strange dream of hers and started writing something about it each day, making herself more interested and devoted to it until it became her famous, well-known book, \"Twilight\". The book became so popular that not only did it sell approximately 100 million copies, but in no time it also became a best-seller. This huge success lead to a sudden interest to creating the book's movie. And later on, what started off as a dream became a reality not only for the author of the book, Stephanie Meyer, but for the movie directors Catherine Hardwicke and Chris Weitz as well, the movie was about to be released. It was first released in Los Angeles premiere in November 17, 2008 and it was not until November 21, 2008 that it released in United States movie theaters. First of all, this movie touches the topics of a teenage, forbidden love, the vampires and werewolf story, way of living and the differences between them both and problems in the society they lived in. The actor Robert Pattinson interpreting our vampire, Edward Cullen, tells us his story when he was transformed into the vampire he is and the different way the Cullen's lived, including their diets of only consuming animal blood and specific characteristics they all had differently. Bella Swan, interpreted by the famous actress Kristen Stewart, was a young teenager, pale skinned, simple girl that always seemed different from other girls and was fond of strange things. There is also Jacob Black, interpreted by the actor Taylor Lautner. He was a werewolf, part of a Quileute Native American, who constantly tried to hit on Bella. The movie makes one's heart melt. It's about a teenage girl named Bella Swan. She lived with her mother back in Arizona, since her mother had a new partner, who happened to have a job where he traveled a lot, Bella felt she was an obstacle for her mothers happiness. Ren√©e Dwyer, her mother, abstained herself from traveling with her partner so she wouldn't leave Bella alone, but way deep inside Bella felt she was making her suffer and was attaching her mother to her. That's when she decided to move in with her father into a small, cold town called Forks. Not much before school was over she started to go to the school there in Forks, where she meets new friends. On her normal day of class, she spotted one of the famously called, the Cullen's, who caused an intriguing feeling on her. She couldn't keep her curious thoughts to herself and asked one of her new friends, Jessica Stanley, about him. Her answer was simple, he was Edward Cullen and the rest of his family members Alice, Emmet, Rosalie and Jasper Cullen never joined, mixed and merely talked to other people. As usual, that caught Bella's attention and found him even more curious, attractive and as an unusual as it seemed she felt he was trying to hide something. The first scenes of the movie gives you, as the watcher, a strong sense of comfort and immediately makes you feel welcome to the forest like and cold atmosphere it shows since the beginning of the movie. Kristen Stewart, which interprets Bella Swan one of the protagonist of the movie, makes the watcher feel each and every one of her feelings. This empathy that makes us connect with her makes us get into the whole trama of the movie since the beginning of it until it finishes and just keeps you wanting to see more of it. Edward Cullen, also hooks us to him. It's not only because of his extremely good looking features in the movie and his honey-colored, melting eyes, it's his mysterious way of looking at Swan that shows the way he desires her so much. At first he refuses the thought of accepting what he feels but then he just lost the strength to keep up with the lies he tried to tell himself, he willingly gave in to what is supposed to be impossible and forbidden, just for her. There are suspenseful, funny, unexpected and romantic scenes that get in a comfortable way down to the watcher. It's also very intriguing the way both protagonists fall in love and fight against the natural form or way of life. There is always that controversy about how vampire and human were not relatable and couldn't be together. There was the constant threats of other vampires because of Bella's blood being so desired by them all and Edward's constant fight to protect her even from himself and natural desire. The music or soundtrack chosen in this movie complements the different scenes perfectly. In some dramatic scenes they bring up suspenseful music and in the romantic ones they bring up very warming songs. For example, in one of the romantic scenes they chose a song titled Flightless Bird, American Mouth from Iron & Wine. This song has the perfect lyrics and rhythm which complemented nicely the scene and that makes you feel butterflies in your stomach just as if you were in love. At last, this movie not only shows you the different types of mythical lives some characters represent, but also how love can take out the best of us. It is a really different movie and I'm sure you will really enjoy all of its component. The great acting, the music, the editing itself and the way it easily gets you involved in it."

    "review": "Do you know twilight? Twilight is written by Stephenie Mayer, and this is the love story between a vampire and a human. When I was a high school student, I read this book written in Japanese. My school's library staff recommended it because I liked fantasy stories. Main characters are Isabella Swan, Edward Cullen, Jacob Black and Cullen's family. Cullen's members are vampires, but they don't eat humans. Isabella is a shy girl and Cullen's family is so beautiful. Jacob is the wolf man, however, this video doesn't show it. In addition, there is James in this story. He eats humans and likes fights and games. He is a dangerous person for Isabella. Isabella is Edward's favorite blood, so he is attracted to her. At first, he escapes from her because he doesn't want to eat humans. However, he can't bear escaping. During his conflict, Isabella researches about his secret and knows the truth. They fall in love and begin to dating. One day, Isabella plays baseball with Cullen's family. During the game, James party comes there, and he realized that Isabella is human. So, he chases Isabella. I think it is the main story in this movie. I have read this story in Japanese. Then, I wanted to see this story. I was very surprised to see it because this video is as expected. This movie is faithful to the original story. While I read this, I imagined beautiful view and person, and everything is attractive. For example, there are many bright green forests. Moreover, the plot is also as the book. Then some characters are not as expected. For example, Carlisle's hair and Jacob hair. I thought Carlisle Cullen has dark hair. In this movie, Carlisle has bright hair. And, in my image, Jacob hair is more shorter than movie's Jacob. However, this video acting exceeds the disagreeable part, and it is so wonderful. The acting is real, so I couldn't believe that it was acting. For example, when Edward bears Isabella's smell and blood, he seems to be really painful. Moreover, Isabella is at a loss for words and can't talk well when she is angry. The fantastic direction makes me amazed. In the scene where Edward is bright like diamonds, I couldn't imagine this scene when I read it. I was convinced of this creative direction. After watching the video, I watched another vampire video which was not the twilight series. Do you like vampire movies? Basically, I don't like vampire movies because some vampire videos are grotesque. I don't like also this video, but I like twilight because it is not grotesque, and so beautiful. Every scene and actor is beautiful and attractive, which draws me into the world of Twilight. Some characters are not as I had imagined, but the awesome casting fits each character. If you have read Twilight once, you should watch it. This movie is faithful to the books. Unlike other vampire videos, this is not grotesque, but this beautiful video sometimes makes you thrilling and attracted. You will be amazed."

Hated hated HATED this movie. Hated every whiny, lifeless, loveless, ridiculous, badly written moment of it. There's the main culprit as to why the \"Twilight\" saga is so universally reviled: the piss poor writing of Stephanie Meyer. Anne Rice, she's not. Hell, she's not even Laurell K. Hamilton. They wrote much better books about sexy vampires than this. And those books are for adults, not tweenagers who haven't moved to second base yet. So infantile and emptyheaded is the attitude towards relationships and being a woman that any MAN in the country would be burnt in effigy for writing something so disgustingly sexist. And yet the person behind this whole miserable franchise is a woman. Some things are best left undisturbed, I guess. I'd give this no stars were it not for the presence of some very talented performers and a director who (usually) has a good eye for what it's like to be a young person. But ultimately this whole enterprise is vile and wrong. Not because of PG-13 content, but it's attitudes and depiction of women. One of the worst films of all time."

It was dark in a gloomy in a romantic way and the story was also pretty good, and I also really liked the baseball scene. But my biggest problem with this movie is the atrocious acting and bland script. Both of those mixed together aren't a very good combination. All of the fun quirkiness that Bella has and the dominance and humor that Edward has is sucked out to give these characters little life and make them appealing (for the most part) to middle school girls. But the movie is just good enough to leave you hanging and wanting more and as a viewer that's all you need to watch the sequel.

This movie is better than New Moon, but not by much, and only because Bella doesn't exempt any suicidal impulses throughout. Stephanie Meyer's books are average. But the movies are a terrible representation of the Twilight series. The characters are undeveloped and sallow. Movie Bella does not properly represent book Bella. Edward's lines, though perceived as cleverly coquettish and romantic by some, are corny and a bit creepy. The plot was dull, too. The setting is a mundane highschool, and some rainy town in Washington state. It takes places sometime within the century. The plot and characters are dull and annoying.

Teenage romance is proof that women are only looking for a mysterious stranger to define their unique place in this world. Kristen Stewart is a terrible actress but no performance shines in this bleak film. Given the rampant use of vampire powers and random killings everyone else in this town should have solved the mystery of vampire just like Bella Swan did. PTI but like I said in my 50 Shades of Grey review why give the characters ironic names? Bella (bell of the ball) and swan (what the ugly duckling becomes) showcases the metaphor of her transformation from misunderstood loner from a new town to the most polular girl in school hanging out with the mysterious popular kids. It's a fairy tale. That's what this film is, a modern fairy tale. and if you're an adult like me you'll see through this lazy attempt to corner the tween girl audience"

Twilight also features steady direction, fascinating visuals, and a consistently fine score. It's no surprise that the film's built-in audience devoured it in droves, but Twilight is worth sinking the teeth into for those unfamiliar with the books, too.

    "review": "Grade: Firmly 5/10 Twilight is a fantasy romance film based on the novels of the same name and boasting vampires and love. It's safe to say this move is not the best although I will add it never completely fails and as a piece I think it can be thoroughly enjoyed, but only by some. With a cast that isn't all bad you'd expect great characters but in the end they end up pretty annoying and as if the person who first created them was not thinking straight at all. The plot is gloomy and the setting, even gloomier, but what Twilight does is draw you in, whether it's the pretty good romantic plot or the thrilling last quarter, or even if your in awe at how bad it is, I guarantee interest. It has it's plot holes that we so often see in this age of franchise movies and it's not done to the best degree either, although with very few effects I commend it for sticking itself to the ground and not giving in to too much green screen and the such. Kristen Stewart as our main gal Bella is poor here and although her chemistry is seen with our main man Robert Pattinson, she still just can't pass this off as a good performance. On Pattinson's performance well he is isn't so bad but his awkward body language and speech make for well, awkward scenes, and when he and Belle are together it can almost feel silly and not well done. The supporting cast are again drawn in to this awkward feeling and no star turns are found anywhere with rather competent actors looking dazed and confused and befuddled at what the hell is going on here. Catherina Hardwicke directs and although not destroying it, she deals a lot of the endless list of damage. She creates these scenes that are dull and almost meaningless, and although like I said you can be drawn into this film, that mainly goes down the books author Stephanie Meyer. I felt the script was poor, now I'm not sure whether that's the books talking or the screenwriters but someone has made a mistake here and made a rather cute albeit dark relationship, unbearable to listen to. It's not that this movie is hell on the screen but it's just the point that no one seems good, and overall I can't really think of much to compliment, although strangely I felt by the end it was just about an average piece of movie telling. Look Stephanie Meyer has obviously created a group of books well loved by its fans and the pressure some of those fans put on critics who dislike this movie is proof they really have fallen in love, but those who haven't read them may just feel instead of falling in love, your draining love instead. I think what would have improved this was just a little more reality and less awkwardness and angst, it could have been so much more well made but instead not only the director but the actors and writers have ruined a golden chance and made it so-so. Overall I gave it a 5/10 as I felt it is a middling film, this may battle with your thoughts for a while after and it really does make you think about liking it, and then hating it. Give it a go I urge you, you don't forget it quickly and there are thrills to be had, many will and do like this but many don't, be sure to make up your own mind before deciding and work out whether your team twilight or your out."

    "review": "Even though there were a couple of differences between the book and movie Twilight, it was still a good adaptation. One of the big parts in Twilight is when Bella gets stalked by four men in Port Angeles. In the story, Bella thinks \"But they were both staring at me.\" This part was also included in the movie. The whole saga is based upon Bella and Edward's relationship. After Bella is herded by four men, Edward comes to rescue her, and she starts to realize how much Edward cares for her. This scene was, thankfully, was included in the movie, and was portrayed the same way I imagined it, making it a good adaptation. In the movie adaptation of Twilight, Edward stops Tyler's car from hitting Bella. The same thing happened in the book. An excerpt from the book reads \"Two long, white hands shot out protectively in front of me, and the van shuttered to a stop a foot from my face, the large hands fitting providently into a deep dent in the side of the van's body.\" One thing that makes a good movie vs book adaptation is the story sticking very close to the plot line. The part of the story mentioned above where Tyler almost crushes Bella with his car is crucial to the story. The scene from the movie matched the excerpt perfectly, making this a good adaptation. Edward is very well known for being a vampire. His whole family is hunted by \"the others\" while playing a baseball game with Bella in both the movie and book. In Twilight the book, it says \"they emerged one by one from the forest, ranging a dozen meters apart.\" As I was reading Twilight, I imagined the scene just like they portrayed it in the movie: Three people emerging from this dark and eerie forest that were on a mission to kill. Another thing that makes a good adaptation is if the movie scene looked just like what you pictured it to be in your head while reading the book. This happened for me, and that's a sign of a good adaptation. All in all, the book Twilight was adapted well into a movie."
