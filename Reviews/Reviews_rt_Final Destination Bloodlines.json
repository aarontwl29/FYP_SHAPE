I think \"Final Destination 2\" is the best of them, and while the three that followed dimmed a little more with each outing, I still found them highly entertaining. I just enjoy the complicated \"Rube Goldberg\" -style \"accidental\" deaths, which feel like they were inspired by \"The Omen\" series, another favorite of mine. \" Final Destination: Bloodlines\" is a fun return for the series. It's gruesome and macabre, and the kills are inventive. It's pretty much played for Dark Comedy. The cast is competent but feel like they were plucked off the \"Discount\" shelf. The most recognizable actor is Brec Bassinger, star of The CW's \"Stargirl\", who figures in the film's outlandish prologue. The late, great Tony Todd bids farewell with a mournful cameo."

Personally, I feel like a death sequence is supposed to leave you terrified of being in a situation like that but, besides the Skyview, a lot if the deaths felt very unlikely to happen and almost forced. Years from now, I think the only deaths that I'll remember from this movie is from the beginning (maybe the lawnmower too RIP Uncle Howard). I wish writers made Stef more likeable and a better Lead. She's a great actress but the script didn't help. In future movies, give us a better protagonist and more supporting deuteragonist. Story wise: strong intro, OK middle, weak ending. Definitely not the best in the franchise but not the worst."

That film was the first I was able to see in theaters and it gave me a fear of roller coasters so bad that some still make me wince today (sorry Orlando, you won’t get me on Velocicoaster). That’s neither here nor there, the franchise has always been exciting. Even the unanimously disliked 4th entry had some exciting moments. Walking into the 6th film in the franchise, you sort of know what to expect, almost like….a premonition….. This movie was so, SO much fun in IMAX with a crowd of people who just as excited to see a new entry for the first time in over a decade. It delivered what I expected from this franchise but with a bit more emphasis on familial trauma that you’d expect in a drama than in the same franchise where a guy with a camera asks girls to flash him during a roller coaster loop. The family angle made it feel more focused even if it wasn’t exactly free of wonky CGI or plot hole storytelling. One highlight I can’t stress enough was that opening. Holy hell, you’d think they couldn’t one up 5’s epic bridge collapse but damn did this almost give titanic esque moments during its best moments. The kills were easily some of the most violent in the franchise and while the ending left more to be desired, I can’t help but smile knowing there’s likely more entries to come. A fun, fun time all around and definitely in the top 3 in the franchise."

    "review": "T²C² ( Tongue To Cheek Celluloid) I am not personally a fan of the genre . Mostly because it is far too formulaic and predictable. Just a bunch of variations of the same old worn thing that's been done thousands of times before with the same character in a different mask. This is exactly why there are so many spoof films on the genre. However I have to acknowledge that this was not a simple slasher movie. In fact we never even see the slasher. Much like \" Jaws \" unintentionally did not always show the protagonist, which turned out to be much more impactful, we never see this villain. And \" the theatre of the mind\" is an awesome writer. It leaves the possibilities limitless. Instead of relying on easy to execute, simple to write cliche \" jump scares \", the writers cleverly used the films premise to create suspense and tease the audience to build you up with suspense , until unpredictably the unthinkable actually does occur. The tragic events were really well thought out, original and creative. There is a very fitting analogy to describe these scary scenes. It's the classic boardgame \" Mousetrap\" There are many series of well thought seemingly unconnected serendipitous evens that all connect and have to take place in the correct order to cause the unfortunate demise of the characters. And then the ball eventually drops in them. They dont just lose their noggins from a guy who jumps out of a closet with an ax accompanued by a few shrieking violin strokes. Nope, too easy for this crew . There was one scene early on remiscent of one of the most humorous scenes in \" Hitch hikers Guide To The Galaxy\". The scene where the cute little creature is exhuberantly overjoyed to see the ship land, then unexpectedly gets flattened by the ships door. That kind of humor. There is a perfect word in German to describe much of the laughs . This film is loaded with \" shadenfreude\". The joy derived by someone from the misfortune of others. The VFX, CGI and prosthetics are all first rate. So if you are a fan of the genre and a fan of well written and well executeddark humor, this one is for you. shouid like this one. Guaranteed to have a sequel."

It's funny, nasty, fun, suspensful, you care for the characters, and the deaths are TOP NOTCH. The opening sequence is closely second to the Bridge Collapse in Final Destination 5. Number 7 coming soon! Hopefully in 3 years or less like the previous sequels were released."

However, as an avid fan of the Final Destination franchise this failed to meet expectations. The overload of CGI deaths, the pacing issues, and story that doesnt seem quite fleshed out places the 6th entry of the Final Destination near the bottom (still much better than Final Destination 4). There is still some things this film gets right which includes one of the best opening premonitions of the franchise, a great final performance of Tony Todd, and at least two great death sequences to add to the collection. Overall its a fun time and should be watched in theaters."

    "review": "\"Final Destination Bloodlines\" came out this weekend, and it is the 6th movie in the Final Destination franchise. It has been 14 years since the last one came out. This movie was directed by Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein, starring Kaitlyn Santa Juana, Teo Briones, and Rya Kihlstedt. This movie is about a family who has been marked by Death because their grandmother saved many people after seeing a premonition. After her death, her children and grandchildren must work together to try and escape their fate. Starting at the beginning, I really liked this opening premonition. They threw me off because it was a girl having a premonition of something that happened to her grandmother in the past. There were a variety of kills, and it took a little to get to the carnage. The kill sequences in this movie were also very good. I loved the rube-goldberg sequences. They were unique, and there were great fake-outs. This movie was the funniest so far to me due to the outrageous kills and strong cast. The family had a great dynamic, and they added to the humor. There is one character in particular that is very funny. Tony Todd also gave his final performance. We learned some background to his character, and it felt like a final goodbye to his fans. This negative doesn't have to do with the movie I think, but there were multiple scenes where the audio sounded off. I think it was the theater though. I hope so. We did not get new lore about Death or their design. It feels like a similar formula to the other movies, but I think it was better executed, for the most part. Like the other movies, this movie struggled with the ending. The third act is like 5 minutes long. It ended so suddenly, which is disappointing. Overall, \"Final Destination Bloodlines\" was a very good movie in this franchise. CGI gore may be hit or miss to some, but I thought it was fine. I recommend going to see this new one if you enjoyed the previous ones."

Watching it, it feels like Death isn't just playing with the characters, but also with me, since I can never predict what's going to happen next. The director and screenwriter have captured the essence of the series while cleverly subverting its formulaic patterns. Even though we know none of the characters can escape death, the smart plot twists keep me guessing about who the next victim will be. That, to me, is what's great about this movie."

Bloodlines is a good movie too. For me anyways. Obviously this movie sucked for some people but this kind of movie is very subjective. People will love it or hate it. I'm in the middle. I liked it.

    "review": "Final Destination: Bloodlines doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it doesn’t need to—it knows exactly what franchise fans came for. Centered around Stephanie, a college student haunted by nightmares tied to her grandmother’s premonition decades ago, the film cleverly expands the Final Destination mythology with a chilling twist: what happens when someone who wasn't supposed to live creates an entire bloodline? The kills are as creative and gruesome as ever—true to the franchise's signature style. From the rooftop restaurant disaster to the Rube Goldberg-style chain reactions, Bloodlines delivers on shock value and suspense. What it lacks in innovation, it makes up for in execution. The storyline is surprisingly tight, and the generational curse concept adds an eerie layer of inevitability to the deaths. While it doesn’t break new ground, Bloodlines earns its place in the Final Destination canon. It’s entertaining, gory, and will keep fans of the franchise satisfied—even if it leaves others wondering if the franchise should finally rest in peace."

With all that fresh in my mind, I'm ready to write this review! This Final Destination sequel delivers in every possible way a fan of any of these movies could ever want, and beyond. I say \"and beyond\" because it has something special that the previous Final Destination films don't have-- the overpowering element of family. In fact the word \"Bloodlines\" is so apt because the thread of FAMILY is so strong in this story. The fact that the characters are all related (and so closely bonded) allows us to care so much more about their survival. Their genealogy also gives us an incredible doorway into the story and the magic of the film franchise itself, i.e., we get a very satisfying origin story of the decades-long feud with Death we love so much. Watching the characters bicker, support each other, and fight for each others' survival is truly what elevates this sequel above the rest. And I have to give credit to the cast for being SO INCREDIBLY BELIEVABLE as relatives-- they really bring it! Even watching from the outside we feel like we are part of the family. Needless to say, if you come from a large family of siblings & cousins, this is the horror movie for you. STORY: great. ACTING: Incredible. KILLS: Holy hell. Add to this all a one-of-a-kind (and, sadly and poetically, his final) performance from beloved Final Destination actor Tony Todd, and you have the perfect movie. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now let's go see it a fourth time!"

And the second death scene was also amazing. I loved the third death scene🗑️. Honestly I feel so vindicated cuz I always have found that way of going out terrifying! And the next two deaths. I don't want to spoil but, beautiful! It's a final destination film. If you enjoy them I definitely suggest going to see it! But there are a few issues I noticed. (Spoilers) I will say though I do have some gripes one. Maybe I missed it but I didn't see any reference to 180. Too. The CGI was really bad! Like I know it's a final destination movie and the CGI has always been kind of not amazing. But this was on a whole new level that just took you out of the movie. It's Bad! Also, a lot of the CGI covered up the beautiful practical effects they did and that really bugged me as as again the CGI kind of sucked and there was too much of it. Hopefully they will fix the CGI for the dvds and streaming, Finally death never skipped anybody. There's a fake out death and I'm not going to spoil it. but honestly I kind of missed the skipping and who would be next on death's hit figuring out the list. Final destination is such a formula film, I kind of was like aww. But overall I really enjoyed it and I suggest it. I will say though if they keep just making it via the bloodline idea and plot. I'm going to get a little sad. I do like the random people having to come together to try and stop death. Watching an entire family get wiped out is kind of a little sad. Beautiful, but sad. If you enjoy the films I definitely suggest seeing it! Amongst the other films, I would rank it like this 1. FINAL DESTINATION 3 2. FINAL DESTINATION 2 3. FINAL DESTINATION 1 4. THE FINAL DESTINATION 5. FINALE DESTINATION BLOODLINES 6. FINAL DESTINATION 4 6"

Having seen the original final destination films this was a true return to form and honestly I think the team behind this knew who their audience was and what they were going to be looking for. Now, were there moments that were unrealistic that made me groan and rub my forehead? Oh 100%, honestly I'd have been disappointed if there weren't. But ultimately this film did what all of the final destination films did so well. Make something somewhat believable enough to make you think the scenarios in the film could happen, but at the same time being ludicrous enough to comfort you into knowing that a ceiling fan really doesn't have anywhere near enough power to lift you up; no matter how much you suspend your disbelief. However, despite groaning at parts and knowing full well certain deaths are an impossibility, I still enjoyed this film, I had fun, and it made me laugh oh and not to mention Kaitlyn Juana plays the role exceptionally well, even if her introduction to the audience is somewhat startling (I really am a lean, mean pun machine). Now even though it's a true cliched return to form; there's one thing I have to mention. And that is that audiences who are familiar with the tropes of the previous films will smile when Bloodlines reaches it's Final Destination! Pun, well and truly intended."

The Not So Good: • Plot Mechanics: Some plot mechanics feel contrived or inconsistent with earlier films. • Supporting Characters: Some extended family members serve primarily as victims within the narrative. The Verdict: Final Destination: Bloodlines is a welcome return to form for the franchise, delivering a suspenseful and thrilling ride. With solid performances and dynamic direction, it's highly recommended for fans of supernatural horror."

Every single second of this film is stupidly entertaining, from the insanely gory opening sequence, to the absolute jaw dropping domino effect that lasts throughout the entire film, I was blown away by just how fun this movie is!! I won't spoil it or anything, but this film officially has the worst child in all of fiction, and I'll just leave it at that. Also, the characters in this film are really well written, I legitimately didn't want to see any of them die which almost never, ever happens for a horror film. Usually for movies like this the characters are just canon fodder for the spectacular kills, but here everyone is actually fleshed out and the scenes where they inevitably die are really intense and nail-biting. The film is also incredibly funny, it has such a sick sense of humor and very early on the film establishes that there are literally no lines it won't cross, and that made for some of the funniest uses of dark humor I've ever seen. If you can't tell I loved this film and was extremely pleasantly surprised seeing as this was my first Final Destination film. It was extremely fun, very gory, and stupidly hilarious. Amazing horror film."

    "review": "Final Destination: Bloodlines - A Bloody Good Time, But Let's Call it a Day. After over a decade of silence, Final Destination: Bloodlines crashes back onto the screen with a healthy dose of wild death set pieces and the kind of lore expansion that’s either delightfully ambitious or wildly unnecessary—depending on how much you're willing to forgive. The familiar formula of premonition, near-miss, and increasingly intricate demises remains the core of the experience. You'll find yourself wincing and maybe even chuckling at the sheer audacity of some of the \"accidents.\" \"Bloodlines\" manages to entertain, largely thanks to its commitment to delivering the over-the-top kills that the franchise is known for. There are some genuinely creative and squirm-inducing moments that will satisfy gorehounds. But the true standout of this installment is undoubtedly Richard Harmon. He chews up every scene he's in with a captivating intensity. While the rest of the cast delivers adequate performances, Harmon's presence injects a much-needed dose of charisma and watchability. He elevates the film whenever he's on screen, making you genuinely invested in his character's fate. Tony Todd’s return is brief but welcome, and there’s a surprisingly emotional thread through Iris’s (Rya Kihlstedt) storyline that ties back to the franchise’s roots about fate, fear, and control. Final Destination: Bloodlines is a fun-enough entry that scratches the itch for creatively gruesome fatalities, but the franchise has now looped itself into a narrative corner. There’s nothing left to say that won’t unravel the rules even more. This was a solid send-off. Let it rest."
