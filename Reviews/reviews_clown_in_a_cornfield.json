I was so excited, I went to a late showing. Unfortunately, it missed its mark. It‚Äôs a standard slasher film. You saw it before and done better. The big gimmick in the movie was Frendo the clown, but unlike Art in Terrifier, they never developed the character for you to care. This is another ‚ÄòIf you saw the trailer, you saw the best parts‚Äô movie. There were a few laughs, but not enough to stay up late for. Wait for Netflix for this one."

That‚Äôs what‚Äôs so disappointing, especially since I really enjoyed Tucker and Dale vs. Evil. That movie was smart, original, and hilarious. This, on the other hand, felt lazy and flat. There was nothing new here: the kills were uninspired, the gore was minimal, and the overall execution felt recycled from a dozen other forgettable horror flicks. Then they threw in some last-minute ‚Äúwoke‚Äù messaging‚Äîlecturing adults about destroying the environment and disrespecting the next generation and their ideas, plus a forced bit about being gay‚Äîwhich I‚Äôm guessing is what helped boost the critic scores. These themes felt shoehorned in, not earned, and definitely didn‚Äôt make the movie any better. In the end, it wasn‚Äôt scary, it wasn‚Äôt clever or original , and it certainly wasn‚Äôt worth the time. I wish I‚Äôd seen something else."

      "review": "Somehow Clown in a Cornfield feels like a horror movie beamed in from the 90s ‚Äî in the best way possible. Its rare to see a modern slasher that pays homage to that era without being overly nostalgic or gimmicky. From the gritty, almost voyeuristic cinematography that echoes The Blair Witch Project to the sharply delivered dark comedy that channels Scream. this movie leans into vintage horror vibes while still feeling fresh. Its funny, brutal, and smarter than it lets on. Beneath the killer clown chaos is a pointed bit of social commentary ‚Äî about generational divides, moral panic, and how horror itself is evolving. Its got that modern flair without abandoning the fun, making it self-aware but never smug. The humor actually lands, which is rare in horror-comedy, and the pacing keeps things tight and engaging. Sure, a few side characters feel undercooked, and the satire couldve pushed even further, but overall this feels like a film that knows exactly what its doing: delivering thrills while saying something. A slasher with style and a brain, for sure."

But I needed to prove my bravery, so‚Äîthere I was, sitting in the theater, trapped in the seat from paralyzing terror. I wasn‚Äôt watching a movie, I was entering my worst nightmare. And for those who don't know, I am a little afraid of clowns. I‚Äôd rather be trapped in a pit full of spiders than even look at a single clown face. The film starts off as expected. A clown, in a cornfield, killing. Just like the trailer. Just like the title. Clown in a Cornfield. Then, BAM, out of nowhere, clowns. Plural. Bursting from every direction and not just in THE cornfield. They were everywhere. And killed everyone in the most violent ways possible. I‚Äôm not talking about \"hey, I‚Äôm here to juggle\" clowns. These are nightmare clowns. You know, the kind who look like they were rejected from \"Scream\" movies for being too creepy. And they just kept coming. I swear, they multiplied like some sort of evil circus virus. The clowns in this movie didn‚Äôt just kill‚Äîthey terrorize. They had squeaky shoes. Chainsaws. And every time one of them made eye contact with the camera, my soul left my body and I in fact met my ancestors. They had this uncanny ability to make every small movement feel like a personal attack on my nerves. Literally, every time I close my eyes, I see them in my nightmares. I honestly lost track of the plot because every time a clown appeared on screen, I started convulsing from terror and clutching my friend‚Äôs arm like it was a life raft. The acting and the lines? Hilarious. Very ‚Äúteen movie‚Äù in that respect. The plot resolution? Oh, you bet the clowns are defeated. But only after an hour and a half of nonstop terror. It's like if someone put a horror movie and a circus performance in a blender and hit \"puree.\" There‚Äôs no stopping it once it starts. And I‚Äôm still recovering. Would I recommend it? Well, if you hate yourself and enjoy a good mental breakdown, sure, go ahead. If you're like me and experience existential dread at the sight of anything resembling a clown, run. I‚Äôm still wondering if I need therapy now. Final verdict: The only thing scarier than this movie? The fact that someone thought this would be a good idea."

Miss Douglas does a good job carrying the film, and once all hell breaks loose has some iconic lines, including, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lot of Frendos,‚Äù delivered in a droll but funny tone. I would have given this film a solid four out of five, except for what this director did at the very end of the film, placating a certain generational cohort. When will these directors, and Hollywood in general, take their cues from massive blockbusters like Mission impossible? You don‚Äôt see any of any of this social nonsense going on. I hope the whole industry starts to understand that the younger generation is not necessarily their target audience. It‚Äôs those of us who have been going to movies forever. And love the experience. We just don‚Äôt want to be force fed any of those shenanigans like what happened at the end of this film. Still, I give it a thumbs up. Overall, it was not only entertaining and funny, it was a decent horror movie."

      "review": "\"Frendo\" the clown is coming to Kettle Springs for \"Clown In A Cornfield\" and you don't want him at your children's birthday party. Never mess with \"Frendo\"! After all the fear of clowns is a real thing, it's called \"Coulrophobia\", so imagine a Killer Clown in a frickin' cornfield. This is one of Stephen Kings fave rural places to freak people out. \"Coulrophobia\" is an intense, irrational fear of clowns and it can manifest as strong anxiety or panic when encountering clowns in person, through images, or even videos. It worked for \"IT\" and many other horror movie box office hits. So, why not riff on this popular device? This movie opens with a horrific scene from 1991, then flashes forward to the present in town where the surviving adults could do with a semester at charm school. History has it the one and only local factory burned down in a horrendous fire ruining the towns economy and costing a few lives. Local teenagers were naturally suspected, because you just can't trust those pesky, hormonal, Tik Tok obsessed kiddies. It's a bit of a cliche, but the first of the town teens group to die is a black youth. Which begs the question, \"will there even be a survivor girl?\" Watch out for: creepy Jack in the Box type toys that signify another death just around the corner and the funny analogue phone scene. Another cliche is the Foundation Day Parade. What could possibly go wrong? The kills are inventive and some original. At one point there are multiple \"Frendos\" with the head clown channeling Batman's \"the Joker\". I'm sure DC's lawyers are already onto it. The action takes place over one confusing night when local heroes are outed and pitchforks get a work out. \"Clown In A Cornfield\" delivers what it says on the box. It's not trying to be anything more than a tribute to the teen 80/90's horror/slasher flicks and it does this well. It will find its audience and maybe even some Generation X'ers who remember those good times. All I can say is vote one Glenn Maybrook for Mayor proudly sponsored by Baytown Brand Corn Syrup."

      "review": "A Bloody Good Time with a Few Stumbles. Eli Craig's Clown in a Cornfield (2025) isn't just another slasher flick; it's a surprisingly clever and wickedly fun ride that carves out its own niche in the horror-comedy landscape. What makes this film particularly engaging is its ingenious use of the generational divide in the storytelling, a refreshing approach that feels both timely and genuinely integrated into the mayhem. The setup is classic slasher territory: a group of teenagers in a seemingly sleepy small town, a dark local legend, and a series of gruesome murders. However, Clown in a Cornfield elevates this familiar framework with well-developed characters that you actually root for. Katie Douglas delivers a standout performance as Quinn Maybrook, the new girl in town with a troubled past. She embodies a resilient and resourceful spirit, hinting at a potential future scream queen in the making. Her interactions with Cole (Carson MacCormac) and his group of friends feel authentic, and their dynamic provides both comedic relief and genuine emotional stakes as the body count rises. he filmmakers clearly had a blast dreaming up creative ways for the sinister Frendo to dispatch his victims, ranging from the brutally direct to the darkly comedic. These moments are visceral and entertaining, satisfying the slasher cravings while never taking themselves too seriously. Adding another layer of intrigue are the well-placed slasher reveal twist. Just when you think you have a handle on the mystery, the film throws a curveball, effectively subverting expectations and adding to the overall suspense. These reveals are earned and contribute meaningfully to the unfolding narrative. However, the film stumbles somewhat in its final act. The ending feels rushed and tonally inconsistent with what came before. It's as if the filmmakers had a different, perhaps more impactful, conclusion in mind but were forced to pivot. While the final confrontation has its moments, it lacks the same level of polish and satisfying resolution that the rest of the film delivers. This slightly deflated ending prevents Clown in a Cornfield from reaching its full potential. Despite this misstep, Clown in a Cornfield remains a highly enjoyable and original horror-comedy."

      "review": "Killer clowns are a little uncommon nowadays as they are in the fun, even from underrated bad horror/slasher films. I've seen my fair share of killer clowns from Killer Klowns from Outer Space, Stitches, the IT franchise, old and new, and the Terrifier films that I'd started getting into and they were a fun time. What they always have in common are laughs and carnage along with the story being simplistic and having a cast that can go in both ways. Ranging from seriously interesting and fun or funny, one-noted and stupid. With a movie involving a killer in a clown costume under a low budget, Clown in a Cornfield is somewhere in the middle. It's technically fun on its own terms in account of the story, the humor, and the carnage. I'm not too familiar with Eli Craig except for a famous movie he directed, called Tucker & Dale vs. Evil, which I might give that a watch in the future since I like a little comedy and horror as long as it's done great. This might as well be my introduction because of what I've said earlier. His idea of a clown in a rural town surrounded by a cornfield, Children of the Corn, eat your heart out, stalking a group of teenagers who are partying. Yes, it's one of those kinds of movies that I remember from other horror movies that range from bad to okay. With a new kid in town who'd moved in with her dad, who is the new doctor in town. Now Quinn, played by Katie Douglas, is a fun character, along with being the final girl. Her dad, played by Aaron Abrams, is also fun for being an overprotective father while growing as a character nearing the end. You also have the rest of the cast ranging from the adults who hold their role in tradition. You also have teenagers who are just playing teenagers who would party, drink, and post YouTube videos involving Friendo the Clown. Yes, they are pretty much your usual troupe of high school kids in a clique, but they are fun to see them through the end, whether dead or alive. It's a horror/slasher movie at the end of the day. For the adults, they're also like a troupe, but they're also having fun with it like teenagers. Now let's talk about Friendo the Clown, who is a fun killer. Both in the carnage and the humor department. Reasoning with why Friendo is going around is a bit odd, yet it's all about the laughs and the blood being spilled. Basic kills as the suspense of the movie works well when the kids are figuring out why there is a wild Friendo that isn't in their YouTube videos, killing them off one-by-one. The ending was honestly a good send-off, even for our survivors. This is based on a book of the same name and would like to see the sequels, being two of them according to when I was looking up information of the books and where it all ends. Might even read the books after seeing the first film and before the sequels come to the big screen. For all the fun that I had with this, I give this movie eight killer clown lurking behind the cornfield out of ten. 8/10."

The film had a good father and daughter dynamic and some good carnage candy and gore for all of you coming to see this film for the kills. All in all I thought it was a fun and interesting film that you will either appreciate and have fun with or this just won't be your flavor of film. Everything said and done I would give this film a 6.5/10! If you have seen it let me know what you thought of this film!! #ClownInACornfield"

I prefer an unapologetically bad movie, like you didn't have the budget, decent actors, or a good writer(like this movie), not one that tries to conceal those flaws with a political agenda. I feel like the clowns from Killer Clowns From Outer Space and Pennywise are sarcastically saying to Frendo, \"Really, this is what you think I do\"? The only way this movie resembles any of its predecessors is in a \"fun house mirror\". At best, this movie is a student entry into the AfterDark, ScreamFest, or Fright Night festivals of the 90s (but not a winner). They used to say, \"Those who can't do...Teach\". To Adam I say, \"Those that can't write...Don't be mad UPS is hiring\"."

The story quickly turns into a showdown between the teens and the adults, but honestly, the teenagers were so cringe-worthy that found myself rooting for the adults... or even the clowns. While the film had some strong visual elements and atmosphere, the pacing dragged at times, and the ending fell flat due to weak modern character development. It was all too predictable in the end. A few standout moments, but overall, it's a decent slasher flim but the modern twist was the downfall."

The characters aren‚Äôt very good, it‚Äôs way too on the nose and self aware many times, being way overly cheesy and stereotypical through out the movie, no jokes land, kills are extremely basic but lackluster even beyond that if that even makes sense to you and the whole movie story when you get it all tied together is extremely predictable and honestly a super lazy route to me. Me being a horror fanatic I am should‚Äôve had some of this expectation but I really wanted to go in with a blank open mind and that honestly made the experience worse for me. I could maybe see people who have dry taste in horror finding this to be a good movie, but to me this was just an awful attempt at making a new slasher movie that barely even scratches the surface to that category in the first place, and lastly there‚Äôs just a few very unnecessary additives to this movie that really left a sour taste in my mouth as well, and maybe you‚Äôll pick up on it like I did, but I can‚Äôt not recommend this enough to people who enjoy horror and slashers like I do, and aren‚Äôt just ‚Äúcausal‚Äù fans."

While the filmmakers attempted to pay homage to classic 90s and early 2000s slasher films, the execution falls short of expectations. There are a few notable moments of violence, but the overall narrative lacks substance, resulting in a rather unengaging experience. The acting performances exhibit a polished yet lifeless quality reminiscent of Netflix original productions, and the climax ultimately undermined the film‚Äôs impact. Horror films should prioritize entertainment rather than political commentary. Audiences seek escapism and avoid films that serve as reminders of contemporary issues.

      "review": "\"Clown in the Cornfield,\" a chilling new horror film, hit theaters in May 2025. While the movie explores some dark themes, it strikes a balance that ensures it remains engaging without overwhelming the audience with excessive gore. The director skillfully crafts jump scares and maintains a captivating rhythm that keeps viewers glued to their seats. The writing adds depth to the film, particularly during the pivotal reveal that ties the plot to a legacy, adding layers to the clown's character. The storytelling is commendable, providing an intriguing experience that keeps the audience guessing. There are moments where you might think you've figured it out, only to be blindsided by unexpected twists that pull you back into the narrative. The casting choices were exceptional. The ensemble cast created a dynamic chemistry that was enjoyable to watch. The main character, Quinn, portrayed by Katie Douglas, convincingly embodies the \"final girl\" trope. Carsen McCormick's portrayal of Cole, the mayor's son with a hidden secret, adds complexity to his character, even if the secret feels somewhat unnecessary. However, the filmmakers wisely chose not to dwell on it, allowing the story to flow without distractions. Supporting characters Janet and Ronnie bring their own flair to the film. Janet, the seemingly polished \"mean girl,\" manages to maintain her edge without becoming overly aggressive, while Ronnie is the adventurous spirit, unafraid to dive into any situation. Their interactions are a highlight of the film. Tyler and Tucker fulfill similar roles in the boyfriend group, contributing to the overall dynamic of the ensemble. When the entire group of seven comes together, their chemistry shines. Vincent Muller's character, Rust, adds an element of unpredictability; viewers will find themselves questioning his motives and whereabouts throughout the film. Other supporting roles are well-cast as well, including Will Sasso as the sheriff, Aaron Abrams as the town's doctor, and Kevin Durand as the mayor. Each actor brings their character to life without overshadowing one another, focusing instead on creating a compelling story. With the potential for sequels, the friendly clown who serves as the mascot for the syrup could very well become a staple in horror cinema if the franchise is handled with care."

In fact, it‚Äôs a bit of a shame that they went for the R rating, given that this would be a great horror movie for most teenagers who, because of that upgraded rating, might miss out. And given that the book it‚Äôs based on is YA. There is copious swearing and gore, but nothing too scary. The movie handles the exploration of youth chafing against the status quo refreshingly and differently. The teens of this movie don‚Äôt just rebel for rebellion‚Äôs sake. They have dreams and purpose. But also a need to break a few rules because they are teenagers, after all."

      "review": "Is this a bad movie, no. Is it good, let's say good-ish. This is a film that harkens back to 80's slashers with a big dose of tongue in cheek vibes. The pacing starts out slow but the way it gets going is a bit off as a few of the kills are scenes that come up as random set pieces just slapped together and inserted into the film on a whim. They are also very obvious scenes where said character will be sliced and diced. The main characters themselves are OK for the most part but are also played off purposely as cliched which fits the tone this film is going for. There are a few good funny moments here but just not enough of them. The kills are extremely lackluster for a slasher flick with most recently Thanksgiving as an example completely outshining the offings here by a mile. For those complaining this wasn't as good as Terrifier, please stop. Two completely different movies that should not in any way be compared and even so that opinion is subjective at the very least. The secret here in the plot was given away a bit too early for my liking which detracted from the final act a bit. Also once that was revealed the movie became extremely predictable, however to its credit remains a fun romp to some good tongue in cheek moments and comedy. This is not a movie that takes itself seriously, nor should it. It's a fun night out at the movies if you keep your expectations in check, especially if you think you are going to be seeing a scarefest."

Sadly this incredibly weak cast and painfully predictable and transparent flop makes this film one of the biggest wastes of time ever. Everything is so obvious at every step and the very fact people mention this in the same breath as Cabin in the woods is a huge insult. The film comes across as painfully self indulgent thinking it's hilarious and so smart but the funniest thing about this film is that you gave up time of your life to watch this trash. It's not even so bad it's good, it's just Meh. I can't warn people enough to skip this film, don't fall for the self promotion and buzz articles saying it's like other great horror comedies or it's clever, it's not, it's bad and dumb and actually pretty homophobic as when 2 men kiss it prompts another character to announce \"well this is the end to a very weird day!\" Avoid this trash and thank me later."

If they would have stuck to the book, this movie could have been great; as it was, I thought it was just ok. The acting was decent. The plot felt rushed with the the things they decided to cut, and characters' motivations didn't feel as compelling with the changes. There wasn't enough lead time for us to start caring about the characters before they got to the \"fighting for their lives\" stage, so I didn't find myself caring over-much when/how characters died, especially when I realized they weren't sticking to the book in that aspect. Which is a shame, because I think Cesare's kills would have been just as visually thrilling and made more sense to the story. Overall an ok film, but do yourself a favor and read the book."

I'm sure it was shot as an homage to \"Jaws\", but it played like a ripoff of Chrissy running down the beach and into the cornfield, er, ocean. Basically, \"Clown\" contained the basic horror-slasher tropes (chasing teenagers, can't get the car started, etc.), but damned if I wasn't entertained. There was a lot of good here poking fun at certain tropes, like running through said cornfield away from clowns. It reminded me of the Geico spot. But my favorite, (spoiler alert) is when today's youth can't figure out a rotary phone. Big chuckle there! Overall, this is a film worth a look. I probably would rate it higher had I not seen the ending telegraped halfway through the movie. Will there be a second cornfield? Only time will tell."

It is very aware of that and executes it well. I hear people saying the reveal sucks. I did not think so. What i will say is that the movie/ reveal goes in an absolute diff direction then i thought was coming. I have never read the books. So had no idea what to expect or if the reveal is the same.] Like i said i did not see it going that way but i did not mind it. I will say, though. Once one particular scene happens. It told me everything. I knew what they reveal would be, and why. This was the most fun i have had at the movies in a while, and one of the better horror flicks of this year.

However, its focus on being a fun horror-comedy mashup that‚Äôs bearable, funny, and even competent in its meta-humor makes it a worthy addition to the everlasting horror catalog. More importantly, it marks a solid start to this year‚Äôs summer of horrors amid the crowd of high-budget blockbusters. The cast was decent in their roles, and Eli Craig‚Äôs direction and script delivered a solid balance of meta-comedy and slasher gore, even if the scares were underwhelming. Despite that lack of effective frights, the film‚Äôs execution will likely make slasher fans giggle with glee like a clown for the right reasons."

Even though both of these things have been done plenty of times, I have to say this movie still felt enjoyable. It goes through familiar slasher moments but also has moments where it subverts expectations, which makes it a fun watch. I do think the movie feels a bit more indie, but I also think that gives it some charm, and I was impressed by how intense some moments were and how much fun it was to watch. There are moments where the acting and dialogue could have been a bit better, but this has been a trend in slasher movies since the beginning, so I'm not going to be too critical of it anytime soon.
