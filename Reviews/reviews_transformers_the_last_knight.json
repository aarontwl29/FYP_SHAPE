      "review": "Transformers: The Last Knight is a complete disaster of a movie. The plot is an incoherent mess, jumping from King Arthur‚Äôs time to modern-day chaos without any real logic. Optimus Prime, the face of the franchise, is barely in the movie, and when he does show up, he‚Äôs brainwashed for most of it. The dialogue is cringeworthy, the humor feels forced, and the action‚Äîwhile visually impressive‚Äîis just a loud, CGI-filled blur with no real weight. Instead of an exciting sci-fi adventure, we get a bloated, overlong film that cares more about explosions than storytelling. It‚Äôs no surprise this movie has one of the worst scores in the franchise"

In the 1st movie they say the robots JUST arrived on earth, but in this movie they say they've been on earth for thousands for years?? Gotta love the consistency... also, pardon the bias but, cade was soooooo annoying, the part with nemesis prime and bumblebee fighting? Cade get out of the way, you're doing nothing other than shouting nonsense, bumblebee was able to bring prime back on his own. Anyways, wouldn't honestly recommend this movie unless you're insane and just like seeing robots"

And took some note from the animation.they killed off every big name autobot, then try to make a new story of transformer m. But other than that the action in this movie is amazing. Classic Micheal bay movie,classic transformer fights love it. But the movie story line was completely all over the place. After transformers 3 they should‚Äôve kept the same characters and brung out the biggest threat ever which is unicron.its like Micheal bay didnt know what story to give us so he mashed up a couple said F it. Because how do we go from Old fashioned transformers to being samurai‚Äôs then to being knights ?? And bumble bee didn‚Äôt come to earth til the 80s apparently so how was he fighting in WW2 with the American army üòÇ"

I understand that when watching the film it may seem like everything is going too quick but the film was meant to be at least a few years after the last one which is why a lot has changed but to me everything aligns perfectly from where it ended off. This is my personal opinion but I think this film will always be one of my favourites and worth watching and deserves more than 3 and a half stars, so please give this film a chance !!!"

      "review": "'Transformers: The Last Knight' is normal service resumed. I shockingly loved watching the prior 'Transformers: Age of Extinction', no idea how but I truly did. This sequel, however, is more akin to those other movies in the franchise, it's minutely better than - but still as bad as - series worst 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'. It's another entry that lasts for just short of 150 minutes, which is again too long. You do have to respect how much the filmmakers fit into such long run times though, like (bar last time) it's mostly all underwhelming but you can't exactly say there are any proper lull moments in there. The whole English knights construction of a plot here just went through one ear and out the other, admittedly these flicks are nonsensical as it is so I guess this overly entwined plot does feel right at home. On the cast, Mark Wahlberg isn't as fun, though I did mildly enjoy Anthony Hopkins. I still don't get truly annoyed by these movies, even though I properly should. I think it's because there is an essence of the flat-out action that I can find enjoyment in, so things never truly get mind-numbingly dull. With that said, they are most certainly disappointing films (usually)."

This movie is a mess as well, but it is at least fun in the way it does it, kind of like the first three. The humor is on-point, the visuals are much better again, the music isn‚Äôt half-bad, and the feel of the movie returns to its roots. It is not anything groundbreaking, of course, but it does get back into that feeling the first few movies had, and I respect it for that. However, the movie is quite boring at the same time, and barely gets anywhere until the second act. But Mark Wahlberg is good in this one, Anthony Hopkins is absolutely great as usual, and I liked the robot butler, so not all is bad in this one."

Whose decision was it to make the Decepticons come across as comedic and foolish toward the beginning?? They're supposed to be the serious bad guys that are intimidating! Where did Megatron come from out of the blue again?? Why is he still around?? Plus, connecting the transformers to human history and making them exist for hundreds of years of it beforehand barely worked at all compared to the simple and more grounded plot of the original installment, even the 2 movies after that. Sure Optimus Prime had some cool moments and some of the apocalyptic stuff portrayed at the end was somewhat neat, plus the beautiful and sexy Laura Haddock, but I'm talking about very small things/small moments here. Plus that twist mid credits ending that made me roll my eyes? PLEASE!"

      "review": "\"Transformers: The Last Knight\" is a film that attempts to expand the already vast Transformers universe but ends up getting lost in its own ambition. The movie starts off with a sense of mystery and grandeur, delving into the ancient history and mythology that ties the Transformers to Earth. The visuals, as always, are a major highlight. The detailed renderings of the Transformers, whether it's the familiar Optimus Prime or the new and menacing villains, are a sight to behold. The battle scenes are large-scale and filled with explosive action. Cities are destroyed, and the Transformers clash with each other in a display of raw power and advanced weaponry. The special effects team has done an excellent job in creating a believable world where these giant robots coexist with humans. However, the story is where the film stumbles. It is overly complex and convoluted, making it difficult for the audience to follow. There are too many plot threads that seem to be thrown in without proper resolution. The connection between the past and the present is muddled, and the attempts to introduce new elements like the Transformers' role in Arthurian legend feel forced and out of place. The character development is also lacking. The human characters, such as the lead played by Mark Wahlberg, seem to be going through the motions without any real growth or depth. Their relationships with the Transformers are not well-defined, and it's hard to feel any emotional connection or investment in their fates. The film also suffers from pacing issues. There are long stretches of exposition that slow down the momentum of the action, and then sudden bursts of intense battles that feel disjointed. The dialogue is often cheesy and filled with one-liners that don't add much to the overall narrative. Moreover, the movie tries to be both a fun action blockbuster and a profound exploration of themes like sacrifice and the meaning of heroism, but it fails to strike a balance. It ends up being neither a satisfying character-driven drama nor a straightforward, exciting action film. In conclusion, \"Transformers: The Last Knight\" has the potential to be a great addition to the franchise with its impressive visuals and ambitious scope. But its overly complicated story, underdeveloped characters, and pacing problems prevent it from reaching its full potential. It leaves the audience with a sense of confusion and disappointment, as it fails to deliver a coherent and engaging cinematic experience. While it may still have some moments of entertainment for die-hard Transformers fans who are simply looking for more giant robot battles, it falls short of being a memorable and well-crafted film that can appeal to a wider audience. I usually use these two sites for more free movies and short dramas.If you have a better website, please recommend it to me.

This movie portrayed a whole new atmosphere and understanding between the Autobot's and Deceptions‚Ä¶ Seeing how earth once trusted and betrayed the Autobot‚Äôs, but soon relying on their help to save Earth once again, we can never lose our love and respect for them, as they engage in badass but yet emotional battles that get us jumping out of our seats. The Transformer series has been one of the best franchises i‚Äôve watched, and this movie has definitely been the CLIMAX of the whole thing.

Another thing I absolutely loved was the fact that Bumblebee somehow so randomly got his voice back and that made Optimus Prime not violently epicly awesomenessly murder Bumblebee into shreds.

But I felt like I was dumped in an already started film and it also left with an open ended finale. And what I saw just felt like a waste of time even thought monumental things were happening to the world. I didn't like how the scenes jumped around in a disconnected, unfinished way. There was a lot of backstory of ancient history with the Transformers on Earth that was just a bunch rushed exposition. It didn't feel like there was that much connection with the Autobots and the human characters this time around. One character was introduced then pretty much out of the picture for a large chunk. (Which was fine with me because I wasn't that excited about her, it was just strange.) I will say that what I did like was that the fighting scenes of the robots were pretty clear. None of this shaky cam where you can't even tell what you're looking at. There was some cool slow motion shots with that. Strangely enough the moment in the film that I enjoyed the most was seeing Optimus and Bee driving out of disaster in truck/car form. Anyway I just didn't enjoy this one."

And a sad shame cause it leaves so many unanswered questions that will never get solved since this killed the Bayverse. But after a rewatch a month or two ago, it's a so bad it's good movie in my eyes, so I had some enjoyment watching it. Pros -Like the previous films, amazing VFX -Transformers are still awesome, including new ones like Cogman, Hot Rod and Dragonstorm, as well as the returning ones such as the main AOE group, Megatron and Barricade. -Sound design is great -Nemesis Prime is a very threatening character -Some humor is a bit funny -Return of some recognizable characters from the previous films, most notably Lennox -The final battle and Nemesis Prime vs Bumblebee are pretty good. -Music is great CONS: -Very messy story and plot, with a lot of stuff not making sense and becoming very confusing. -Very shaky camera work and the aspect ratio changes too much. -I don't mind Micheal Bay reusing scenes, but during the submarine scene, they crash and reuse the scene where Megatron crashes into a sub after reviving in ROTF, which they didn't even bother to edit it out, it made me laugh so hard. -Various unnecessary scenes that weren't really needed -Humor is hit or miss -Not much good action packed scenes compared to the previous films. -Quintessa was a‚Ä¶ okay villain, also a part of me wished Nemesis Prime was a separate Transformer rather than mind controlled Optimus -Left lots of questions that will never get resolved (ex: how did Galvatron become Megatron again? Sam Witwicky's fate. And Unicron is still around, what will hapoen then?) -The movie marked the end of the Bayverse, which can be upsetting to some since DOTM could have been the end, or the fact we won't get a definitive ending of the franchise."

There's a very important rule in filmmaking, that your jump cuts should be so seamless that the audience shouldn't realise when the jump cut takes place. Look at Marvel movies. When Black Widow fights there are like a gazillion jump cuts in just one somersault. If that is supposed to be silently moving across the room, the jump cuts of The Last Knight are like dragging an almirah across the room hoping no one would notice. You can literally see the jump cuts happen! And speaking of jump cuts ruining the mood, whenever the jump cuts happen in the same scene it feels like it is a completely different scene. Like in the scene where they are in the elevator and they see the butler bot over there, it feels as if the scene outside the elevator is a completely different place. The lighting is also so bad, it doesn't even feel like there's continuity until the jump cut happens again and the camera goes back to Cade and company. Apart from that there is also a scene where Cade stops his car in front of the sheriff and when he's stopping the car there's a lot of dust. But when the jump cut happens the dust is all gone. And while he's still stopping his car his voice starts coming. Like, he isn't even moving his mouth and the words are coming out louder than the car's engine. Another time the ADR ruins the mood is when the butler bot is playing the piano when the story of the Transformers is being narrated. He is asked to stop playing... Twice! A bad joke is repeated twice in just fifteen seconds! Then of course there's the fight between Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, the legendary fight for which everyone came to watch it. Because the movie had been advertised by saying that Optimus Prime is the bad guy in this movie. And guess how their fight ends? Martha! No, not by saying those exact words, but something similar. Just as Optimus is about to stab Bumblebee, he says, \"I'm Bumblebee. I'll lay my life before you!\" And that changes Optimus Prime's mood. First of all, why did it change his mood? He's a robot not a human. Emotions can't alter his programming. And secondly how on earth did Bumblebee suddenly start speaking? It's not like his voice suddenly fixed. It was permanently damaged. It's kinda weird that in this movie the humans are not the bad part. In fact I really liked its starting, where they were showing Merlin take help from the dragon Transformer to win the battle. I also liked how those kids were collecting spare parts to survive. Even showing Optimus Prime on his planet looked so cool. The way it began I was really wondering why on earth this movie has such bad reviews. If the movie focused on either of the two things it could have been a great movie. I really wanted to like it, but the jump cuts were making me laugh even on the serious scenes. I'm sorry, Michael Bay. But I think you've ruined a good movie by hiring a bad cinematographer."

When they thought things couldn't get any worse, they did once Transformers 5 was confirmed. What did we get? Terrible cast performances, especially from newcomer Laura Haddock. Excessively long runtime Little character development Embarrassingly pointless humor You could watch this movie over and over again and still be able to point out all of the flaws. It's that kind of movie that would make you refuse to eat your popcorn even whilst watching it the first time over. Transformers 5 is a funny joke, but with a bad punchline But the funniest part is that I used to think of Transformers 2, 4 and 5 as the best Transformers movies. But I can see the clearer side."

You can't analyze and think too hard on what you see. This is meant to be two and a half hour with amazing special effects, epic music and ridicolous moments. This movie looks so grand and epic on the big screen in cinema, thanks to Bay filming it almost entirely with IMAX 3-D cameras. After an very intriguing prologue set in medieval times with catapults casting fireballs and big armys clashing together in \"Gladiator\" style, we also see Stanley Tucci as drunk Merlin pleading with transformer knights. The crazy tone is set after the first 5 minutes. The movie is like the previous ones, hyperactive and fast paced. There are explosions and fighting, and very few quite character moments. But the few that are work well, especially the \"father-daughter\" set-up with Cade Yeager and Izabella. They have tough love but strong chemistry, and I wish we would see more of them together and more of Izabella, because she was the best actor in this movie. All the other well-known actors seem to know they are in a Transformers movie. They don't take it too seriously, it is all about acting over-the-top and bonkers. The ones that do that best is Anthony Hopkins with his hilarious robot butler \"Cogman\". I think simply they're presence made this movie the funniest out of the 5. The plot is very bloated and stuffed, altough the story is generic and similiar to the previous ones. It is all about finding Merlin's staff, that in Quintessa's hands will rebuild Cybertron and destroy Earth. Earth who is revealed to be Unicron, the ancient enemy of Cybertron. The talisman that Cade gets from a dying knight will lead to the staff. And cybertron is approaching earth rapidly, while also Megatron collaborates with the \"TRF\" who is the new rogue military force. And I haven't mentioned that Optimus Prime gets brainwashed by Quintessa and turns bad. So I could see why this is too much for someone, it was clearly an answer to \"too much of everything\" from the writer's room. But it worked for me. The middle act in London is the most crazy and ludicrous. The final act is an massive showdown of earth shattering preposterousness. An workable ending for the Bayformers, but then we get the stupid cliffhanger which should have been cut out. Personally I would've liked a more grounded movie with less subplots, who is more focused. We could follow the kids we meet at the beginning instead of Viviane and Cade troughout the movie and I would have liked more of Nemesis Prime. This movie clearly had a lot of talent and merits behind the screen, and although the movie is pretty forgettable and hated by many, I still found it to be worth watching. It captured a sense of escapism and if you want to experience a big-budget massive summer blockbuster that also is fun, this is the movie for you. Roll out!"

It's got a genuinely superb, bonkers but weirdly poetic opening with shots and editing that suggest to me that the formula of these movies, distilled and refined over time has more to offer than just new font and new toy designs. It's got Undead Robot Skeleton Knights, it's got a comedy montage where Megatron brokers a deal to release his gonzo robot henchman from human incarceration, it's got Laura Haddock basically playing Lara Croft, it's got a gunfight at Stonehenge, it's got some of the best cinematography, and high-budget fantasy/science fiction visuals ever displayed, it leans full-tilt into it's fantasy. I unashamedly love this movie, and I don't know why, maybe it's the best of a bad bunch and getting the goofiness and character-less robots and homophobia and uncomfortable female performers, and endless desserts and shoehorned romances, and loud screaming sidekicks out of the way, has allowed for a half-decent film about robots kicking ass over Europe. Is the plot utter shit, yes. Is it a complete an utter blast in ever frame in every regard? Yes. Except maybe the aspect ratios, those shifts are inexplicable and ugly, although the IMAX shots are staggering. Which brings me to the 3D which is THE BEST hands down that I've ever seen at home. It's staggeringly good, the image quality with non-active-shutter is sublime and the 3D both in in front and behind the window effects are second-to-none. It's a real shame when you watch a film like this, to acknowledge that the home video experience of 3D has died a death, because a film like this has stars added to it for the love, care, attention, and quality put into this experience. Bay exits the franchise (possibly) after directing his absolute best Transformers film."

Mark Wahlberg and his chemistry with Laura Haddock keeps this section interesting. Overall, this is a fun addition (and now finale) to the main continuity of Transformers films."

There was no reason after Age of Extinction to make another. It starts off with King Arthur, then for some reason we have these kids involved and must team up with the Transformers. The acting is Razzie level, the action sequences can't save it, the massive exposition scenes drove me insane (in between countless yawns). As I watched this movie, I kept saying the same thing over and over. Where was Optimus Prime? Why was this...you know what...I'm ending this review because this is the worst one of the franchise."

      "review": "3 hours of disappointment. most of the entertaining scenes can be seen in all Transformers 5 trailer, the rest is stuffed with prolonged human plot, forced comedy, WWII nazis, and tons of advertisement which is more than the total transformation throughout the movie. The Last Knight not only has no connection with the previous Transformers trilogy, it also has no connection throughout the movie itself. As usual, Michael Bay and his screenwriters decided to add in cliche jokes and a lot of explosions. and somehow the explosions doesn't cause any damage to anyone. As Optimus Prime drifting in space, he probably infected with some amnesia virus, which makes him forgot Cybertron was destroyed during the Chicago War. But TF5 needs an antagonist that Prime can blame on destroying his planet, that's why Quintessa made a Cybertron replica and ready to slap Prime in the face. You are probably thinking: as a Prime, leader of the Autobots and Mr. Leader of Free Galaxy, he will go through immense pain and suffering to get his brain twisted and turned evil, what we get is Quintessa giving a good hard slap on Prime's face and giving some low level brainwashing speech, VOILA! Nemesis Prime is here! Galvatron seems to regain his full consciousness and turn back as Megatron, but there's no back story about how he get his name and classic transformation style back (Michael Bay is stepping up his guessing game in this movie and we have to reason up what is actually happening throughout this movie). He looks like the leader of gangster more than leader of the Decepticons, and his crew members are filled with racial stereotypes and amusing crime records(bank robbery? really?). and why would Megatron chose Mohawk over Berserker? he's supposed to rule the Earth, not just doing some street crimes! but all of these bullsh*t seems to be reasonable in Bay's TF movies, as all the Autobots, who saved Earth from Decepticons and other threats get brutally shut down by the government. However, the Decepticons who destroyed half of the United States and killed millions, gets to live in comfy, hi-tech prison, have the right to negotiate with the government, get some street tattoos and gold chains, and rob a frickin bank. Zero character development, most of the character was unnecessary(or not supposed to add into movie), I was expecting Isabela Moner to actually represent the strength and reliability in this movie like Laura in Logan. What we get was Greta Thunberg ripoff, shouting for no reason, opposite of helpful and try hard to be intelligent and reliable(and of course, it didn't work out). As the movie goes on, we get to know unnecessary information such as Hound doesn't have a father, Vivian is a well developed female with zero experience about love(wtf), and her mom and aunts keep nagging about when will she get married, Hot Rod wasting time to pronounce his name with his French accent, TRANSFORMERS KILLED HITLER? and other fuckery awaits. The idea of getting the staff to take over the world is oddly similar to Night at the Museum 2. After the Iacon Knights guarded the ignition chamber for 1600 years, their eyes must be covered with rust so they can't see and kill a human properly. as an ancient robot race with various choices of high tech weapon: turn into a massive metal skeleton with rusty swords as weapons (still looks cooler than Que and Mohawk). He's back, he's alive, Nemesis Prime is here to chop some knights! after Nemesis Prime had gone rogue, we finally have some decent fight scene to watch! Nah, it lasts shorter than the time used by Hot Rod pronouncing his name. What did Bumblebee do to break Quintessa's curse? The voice of friendship, of course! as the movie was about to end in 30 minutes, so all the Decepticons have to die in 10 minutes, and 30 seconds for Infernocus, at least Infernocus has a quick death, unlike Megatron has to get kill, decapitate and revive throughout the TF movie franchise. After Quintessa get shot in the spine and disappear, the movie has finally come to an end, where Optimus Prime giving inspirational speech, human and robot hugging each other, and watch the sunset until the credits roll. And nope, this is not the end, Unicron and Quintessa probably going to fight in the next Bayverse TF movie and the entire human race are going to hate Transformers even more. Michael Bay should cast Gerard Butler for the next TF move (If there is another) so he has proper reason to save United States every time and slap an American flag on the audience's face for every minute. I pay to watch a Transformers movie, what I got was a bad parody made by some weird Youtube channel(with tons of ad placements) with insulting story line. The CGI model of Transformers was good tho."

The basic plot (which is incredibly basic) is easy to follow but all the hour and half of padding is just completely random and illogical and filled with 'jokes' that only Michael Bay and a 3 year old could possibly find amusing. This feels like it was written by an small child that just wanted to throw a load of flashy (and dull) action sequences together but had no idea how to tie everything together. It really is a mess. It isn't even a film that's so bad it's funny, it's just plain awful and a candidate for the title of the worst film ever made.

It's still better than Age of Extinction and Revenge of the Fallen, but that's hardly a compliment. It doesn't try as hard as either of the movies to be funny, but like every other Michael Bay movie, there were bad attempts at humour and shitty one-liners. There were some nice use of slow-mo shots and this makes it easier to follow the action. There were only two good scenes in the entire film. The car chase scene in London and the fight scene between Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. Speaking of Optimus Prime, he's barely in the film. In this 2 and a half hour movie (which is pretty typical for a Transformers movie), I would say that Optimus Prime had a total of 15 minutes of screentime. He's essentially The Joker from Suicide Squad. A lot of fans have defended the limited screentime that The Joker had in Suicide Squad because he's a supporting character, but Optimus Prime has always been an important character in the franchise. Why did we need John Turturro, the black guy, and the bad child actor more than Optimus Prime? I've never been a Transformers fan, but Optimus Prime has always been the best part about the franchise. And like every other Transformers movie, there's a very long and boring third act action set-piece followed by a monologue from Optimus Prime to end the film. Even when you're starting to enjoy the action, it's ruined by not only bad jokes, but constant changes of aspect ratio. Usually, a big budget movie would film entire scenes (usually important scenes) in IMAX before reverting to its original aspect ratio to make the transition as unobtrusive as possible. But the way Bay uses IMAX, the aspect ratio changes in the same scene with each cut, some of which aren't even a second long. Even shot reverse shot changes aspect ratio. It's distracting and pretty hard to ignore. The same visual mess can be seen in Revenge of the Fallen. It's as if Michael Bay is completely talentless. I know people enjoy the Transformers movies for the junk food that it is and would ridicule me for expecting decent writing. I've given that up since Revenge of the Fallen. For the past four films, I've tried to enjoy Transformers as a mindless action flick, but Michael Bay has been doing the same thing for all of these films. It's really not too much to ask for more substance when Logan, Wonder Woman, and Guardians of the Galaxy 2 offers much more than mindless visuals and loud explosions. Even Fast & Furious 8 does mindless action way better than Transformers. It's a one star for the two good scenes in the entire film."

Despite all this there are some critisicms that can be made about the movie.However I am not going to touch on that since almost everybody has made the drawbacks of this movie very clear and have in fact gone out of their way to highlight them.

      "review": "It should be obvious, to the one person who probably follows my reviews on RottenTomatoes (since I haven't reviewed a film in this franchise on Letterboxd yet), that I've never been a big fan of the Transformers franchise. I'll be honest, I thought the first movie (at the time) was solid popcorn entertainment. But that was still before we were bombarded, figuratively and literally, by these movies. Summer blockbusters have always been about casual, popcorn entertainment, but I do think that there weren't many movies, at the time, like the original Transformers. So, in a way, you could say it stood out and, again, at the time, it was an entertaining movie. With that said and, now, four sequels later (three of which I've seen), I don't know if I could go back and say that the original was a good movie, if I were to watch it again. But, yes, for all intents and purposes, I enjoyed the original movie at the time. 2009 marked the release of the second film in the franchise, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Revenge of the Fallen, in my opinion, has been one of the worst movies I've ever seen in an actual movie theater. I absolutely loathed that movie. It got one star one RT because the special effects were still excellent. If it wasn't for that, I'd have gladly gone half a star, that's how bad Revenge of the Fallen is. It was so bad that I decided to give myself a break and completely skip the the third installment, Dark of the Moon, entirely. I haven't gone back to watch that movie and I likely never will. What would be the point??? Enough time has passed between when I saw Revenge of the Fallen (almost TEN years ago) that Dark of the Moon, as a continuation, would make absolutely no sense to me. Though, if I am honest, it's not like you'll be able to make much sense of this even if you DO follow this franchise's narrative closely. At least that of the \"original\" trilogy. Honestly, I don't know why I came back to the franchise with Age of Extinction. But I suppose the fact that it was a 'new' start with a new cast of (human) characters and it wasn't so tied to the original trilogy. I knew that much was not gonna change as long as Michael Bay was still leading the franchise. And, as much of an improvement Age of Extinction was over, it was still a bad movie. This brings us to The Last Knight which is, hopefully, the last time Michael Bay will ever make us suffer through one of these again. Ok, so, first things first. I know how it's gonna look, giving this film the score I did when I gave xXx: The Return of Xander Cage a positive rating and review. Firstly, at the very least, while there are flaws with its narrative, xXx is fairly cohesive from beginning to end. You know what the goal is for Vin Diesel and his team at all times. Secondly, I liked the cast and the characters ended up growing on you. Thirdly, Donnie Yen. That's all I got. Seriously though, xXx: Return of Xander Cage was definitely silly, but it was fun, for the most part. The Last Knight, on the other hand, is the same type of overwrought, overstuffed and bloated nonsense that you've seen for eleven years now. Not even an astrophysicist could understand even a third of what's going on here, much less decipher any meaning or purpose. Perhaps that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I am not lying when I tell you had trouble discerning anything about the story. I know that Cybertron is on a collision course with earth in order to heal itself. Cybertron healing itself will lead to millions of deaths on earth. That much is fine, it's everything in between that gets you from point A to point B that is so largely terrible. There's something about Merlin's staff that only a direct descendants of his can wield, there's this talisman that attaches itself to Cade for, really, no real reason other than when it's absolutely convenient for the movie to use it, there's this street urchin that is introduced for, again, no reason whatsoever and serves no actual tangible purpose in the narrative of the movie other than to give Cade someone to care for, there's generic military dudes doing generic military things, there's this engineer (played by Tony Hale) who's trying to warn the suits that there's imminent danger here. This character was never given a name, he's just referred to as a JPL engineer in the X-Ray for this on Prime Video. Two-time Emmy Award Winner Tony fuckin' Hale can't even get a name for his character, that's how inconsequential he is. Oh, Optimus Prime is turned evil by his creator. Cade and Vivian, naturally, develop a romance because of course they do, despite not having anything in common or, really, even knowing each other. Megatron comes back and never has he been less effective than he has been in this movie. For SOME reason John Turturro's character returns here, except he's in Cuba, there is this sociopathic transformer Butler that is, actually, the best character in this franchise's history, playing off a cranky Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins and this butler, Cogman, are the best parts of this movie. I was legitimately entertained by the two. Regardless, the point is to make you see how there's so much shit in this movie. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if I missed a couple of things. I don't take notes for movies, that's just not how I do things, so I may have missed more than a few things. But, again, there's no rhyme or reason to anything that's happening. The film does not let you think in the slightest. Everything is an attack on your sight and your ears. This might be one of the loudest movies I've ever seen. This is, obviously, by design, given that if they throw all this shit at you, you won't bother to think about how bad the script actually is at putting together a cohesive and satisfying narrative. And, I know what you're gonna say, that nobody who's a fan of this franchise comes to it for a story. Fine, that's fair, but then what is the point? Why is everything happening??? If they made the effort to, at the very least, tell a coherent narrative with a clear beginning, middle and end with no bullshit, maybe they wouldn't hate this fucking franchise so much. As it stands, it's like the script was purposely put together out of order and filmed this way. Like they just grabbed pages at random and that was the way the script was structured. Because nothing really flows from one scene to the next. It's all justifying the next major set piece. The thing is, though, that the only thing taking them to the next set piece is, umm, a set piece. There's dialogue in between these set pieces, but never have I ever paid less attention at dialogue in a Transformer movie as I did with this one. Well, unless it was involving Burton (Hopkins' character) and Cogman, that was the only time I paid any attention. The humans, naturally, are uninteresting so, of course, they focus more on them than on the fucking giant alien robots that transform into vehicles and other objects. I wonder if there's a transformer vibrator. That's a story I could get into. Things happen and you don't even remember them five minutes later. How many of you forgot that Burton died and Cogman, after honoring his 'master', was never seen again??? Come on now, be honest. It has to be in the high 60s, maybe even in the 70s. Nothing has any weight. The film can't have a poignant moment between, literally, the only two characters I've enjoyed in this franchise, because they're worried that the death might not have enough explosions. I mean, it's a Michael Bay movie, so why Burton couldn't have spontaneously blown up is beyond me. Nothing makes sense in this universe, why should death? Izabella, after being introduced, also disappears into the ether and, again, her character (who could have been cool) amounts to next to nothing, because she serves no real purpose in the long run. Optimus Prime is, really, quite a non-factor in the movie. He's turned by Quintessa into Nemesis Prime and, after that, he isn't seen for a BIG chunk of the movie. Because, for one reason or another, the screenwriters think that people care about these human characters. They don't, they're just talking heads. They're there to deliver the lines that you have on your script. I feel like having people talk in Michael Bay's Transformer franchise is a concession he made because he couldn't just put on explosion, after explosion, after massive robot fight, after explosion without just a little bit of context. I honestly don't know what would be preferable. Because while a lot of the unnecessary fat would have cut out, this ultimately still a poorly-structured action movie. There's nothing wrong with a movie being all-action and no story. The Raid did this and it has gone to be revered (by me) as one of the best action movies of all time. The thing is that you have to know how to structure and edit your action so that everything you're seeing makes sense in how it's choreographed and pleasing to the eyes. The last thing that Transformers is is pleasing to the eyes. I mean it's a very pretty movie when it's standing still, it has that Hollywood shine and gloss all over it, but when it's in movement and when the Autobots and Decepticons are fighting each other, all hell breaks loose. All you see is metal clanking against metal and it's all just a blur. You have no idea what you're seeing at any time. They think that throwing everything AND the kitchen sink at you is what you want. No, not really. Well, not that that can't help, but I feel like a more subdued approach would work so much better than this. Black Panther is a recent example, while the film had action (and it was very good), I feel like they used it sporadically so that when they did use it, it meant more and it had more weight behind it. Then again, Black Panther also has one of the best and most complex characters in the MCU and the most complex character in this movie is, say, well, nobody. Another thing is that the film is shot in THREE different aspect ratios, so expect to see Bay rapidly shift between each in the same scene. It's such an awful and jarring effect. I honestly have no idea what the point of it was. It's like three different personalities tried to direct this movie. But, really, the joke's on them, that's just how Michael Bay really is, he's that stupid to actually shoot the film on three different aspect ratios and then rapidly shift between each constantly throughout its bloated run time. I didn't wanna say stupid, because I feel like that's too personal, but I can't think of any other way to describe it. It's stupid and it's not satisfying to see. The movie, even when it's standing still, can't let up with trying to be jarring, hence the three different aspect ratios. It was awful and I hope nobody ever does this again. Not saying it can't work, but use it tactfully and make sure it's to the actual benefit of your film's visual style. Don't just make another attack on the senses. Is this the worst Transformers movie? Honestly, I don't know. Revenge of the Fallen was an awful experience. I don't know if this can surpass that. What I do know is that if it is not the worst, it is the second worst. It's worse than Age of Extinction and worse than even I could have possibly imagined. I think I've made my thoughts on this perfectly clear. This is the same overstuffed, bloated and overlong bullshit that the Transformers film franchise has been since the beginning. The narrative is a bunch of nonsense and is poorly put together. The characters are awful (minus Burton and Cogman). The action is an incredibly loud mess. If this is what you love, then by all means, watch this movie. But this is still very terrible and with it being the least-successful entry in this franchise, I sure hope that this is the last we get of this goddamn franchise. I'm fine with Bumblebee prequel, which is being directed by the same guy that made Kubo and the Two Strings (a movie that I loved). It's a completely different team and I'm hopeful that they're able to inject some life and, most importantly, quality into this franchise. The main Transformers franchise, however, can fuck off. And, if this is the final nail on its coffin (which it probably won't be, given that studios want to compete with Marvel and the MCU), then good fucking riddance."

      "review": "When a movie is successful the studio inevitably tries to keep milking the cash cow. The next step to the udder of box office revenue is a sequel followed by a trilogy and if possible the Golden Fleece of cinema, the full-fledged franchise. while the horror genre is infamous for the sheer volume of reaching that level along with an unusual measure of longevity. A close contender must be action flicks. Several examples have even been resurrected after decades of inactivity creating a new archetype, the action hero with an AARP membership. One of the more recent popular franchises is the career-defining movies by director, Michael Bay. He took a popular line of toys from Hasbro, resurrecting its spinoff cartoon television show into a series of movies that have become the epitome of action films defined by excessive, over the top special effective with an unavoidable lack of plot or even a modicum of originality. The line of toys that enabled such a substantial collection of movies to exist was 'The Transformers'. Although they seemingly appear to be mundane vehicles running the gamut from big rig trucks to Volkswagen beetles, they are sentient extraterrestrial warriors fighting to keep the universe, particularly planet earth, safe from their evil counterparts, 'The Decepticons'. Both groups routinely rearrange their configuration transforming into anthropomorphic warrior robots. In most franchises a phenomenon referred to diminishing returns is in effect. Each successive instalment of a franchise receives predictably lower critical assessment to the point where film considered here, 'Transformers: The Last Knight', received an aggregate score of around 15%. What guaranteed the continued support of the studio is the fundamental fact that the franchise remains profitable. This latest offering did loss a considerable portion of the investment, but the bottom line oriented executives understand that the income from cable TV, streaming services and home media will likely make up the difference. Using the popular analogy of cinema as a dining experience there are time when you need a fine, five-star meal but other times the guilty pleasure of fast food fills your craving. It, might be the proverbial 'all sizzle and no steak' but it does appeal to the inner child lurking within. There is a certain degree of liberation for a filmmaker such as Mr. Bey when his best-known work has become synonymous with bad movies driven by extraordinary special effects. He realizes that the normal constraints applying to maintain continuity no longer represent a professional or artistic criterion. All that matters is to satisfy the puerile expectations of the target demographic, teenage boys, augmented by adult men still dreaming of a carefree youth in the dark of the neighborhood theater. To this end, Mr. Bey threw caution, and plot consistency, to the wind taking the audience back in time to 484 CE, the period of the legendary King Arthur (Liam Garrigan). The King is shown leading his valent knights against the Saxons. To ensure their victory Merlin (Stanley Tucci) seeks the assistance from the Knights of Iacon, a group of twelve Transformers that were hidden on Earth. Apparently, our planet is a favorite place for sentient machines to hide. The Knights bestow on Merlin yet another powerful extraterrestrial artifact, staff. The Knights then change, combining themselves into a giant dragon with an appropriate Medieval name, Dragonstorm. With the creature's assistance Merlin is victorious over the Saxon. Before the conclusion of this prologue, the Knights warn Merlin that one day something very evil will seek the staff. This is a standard plot device that conveniently connects the past to the present. The story resumes two years after The Battle of Hong Kong; the climactic special effects showcase from the franchise's previous installment. 'Transformers: Age of Extinction.' Resulting from those events all the world governments have renounced the Transformers declaring them outside the protection of the law. The enforcement of this was given to the Transformer Reaction Force (TRF), formed to eradicate all Transformers and any alien robots. The TRF used members of the former elite CIA black ops unit known as Cemetery Wind. Any fan of the genre can easily predict the outline of the next pages of the script. Enormous metallic horns begin appearing around the globe. Near the battle ruined Chicago, a group of kids stumbles across a spaceship that contains one of the knights. As a TRF surveillance drone is about to locate them, a survivor the battle, Izabella, an orphaned girl, rescues the children and Transformers. She is with by her two faithful Transformer companions, Sqweeks and Canopy. They are small versions of Transformers constructed by sundry parts. The primary function of these characters is comic relief and toys ideally suited for marketing. They make their way to one of the persistent human characters, Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg). At this point, some of the pertinent cast members are inserted. The tracking device of fan favorite Transformer, Bumble Bee and a squad of Decepticons including Nitro Zeus, Dreadbot, Mohawk, and Onslaught. They were being detained, but their services were requested by Megatron, the brother of the leader of the Decepticons, and the brother of the Autobot leader, Optimus Prime. This sets the pieces on the board prepared for action. Normally this plot development is referred to as setting the chess board. Considering the over-simplicity of the storyline a checkerboard would be more actuate. As is often the case with franchise degradation, the initial outing represents a sufficiently well-crafted movie to gather a core group of loyal fans. When the first sequel hits the cineplex, the quality is often close enough to its progenitor that with the story directly following the initial that the fans can allow themselves the relative luxury of self-delusion regarding the increasing downward spiral; This movie is considerable down that slippery slope of mediocrity that ultimately is given a perpetual among worst movie lists and notable Razzie winners. When a story possesses such a dearth of original material that a directorial choice to judiciously edit the movie to a concise account could have provided a substantially better experience. Instead the infamous Bay Bloat with a running time of 165. The theater tickets should have included a complimentary tube of Preparation-H. It is certain that only a minuscule portion of the estimated $216 Billion budget allocated to acquiring the services of a professional script doctor. Over six hundred of the closing credits are dedicated to Special Effects and Visual arts with close to a thousand more listing representing stuns, lighting and sound. The regrettable conclusion that is inevitable is that sitting in the dark watching that seemingly endless list of names scroll by is significantly more coherent and arguably more entertaining than the movie. The film is little more than a demo reel of the special effects companies that managed to secure their immediate financial security by winning the contracts to participate in the movie. Considering the expanded profit opportunities afforded by the numerous forms of home entertainment it is feasible that this is not the end of the franchise or Michael Bey's commitment to the financial security of special effects wizard"

The box office grosses certainly do a good job of backing me up on that statement. Same old, same old and NC was right. Well-done special effects and sound design with the humans' performances being ironically, more robotic than the actual robots with decent voice acting. All while Michael Bay and the screenwriters mistake robots cursing and Austin Powers-esque sex jokes for classic comedy. The action sequences aren't even that thrilling anymore and I didn't care what happened to anyone regardless of their benevolence or malevolence. This movie also has terrible editing as well. I could barely comprehend what was going on thanks to the editors jumping from the US to Cybertron to England. Coupled with an annoying change in aspect ratio that aren't even to witness something visually stunning like with Interstellar and Tron: Legacy. It's even when Merlin is trying to reason with a Transformer knight. The continuity has become really convoluted at this point. I may not jump on the Bay-phobic bandwagon but I will agree this movie is awful. Let's hope Travis Knight can do a good job with the Bumblebee spinoff seeing how he already directed one amazing animated movie."

I have watched it twice now, and I must say that it is a very enjoyable and entertaining film to watch. I congradulate Michael Bay for a well-produced and fun cast that delivers one of the better movies of the Transformers genre. Hopkins is an excellent choice to develop all the King Arthur story line is short order. Wahlberg and Haddock provide very enjoyable interactions throughout the entire film. I find the criticism of this film on par with the current misjudgment and mistrust of many critics reviews. It seems they approve the movies that provide funding for themselves far greater than objectively reviewing films with integrity. Many films in the 2017 era can be seen to have a wide disparity between critics and audience scores. This film was an exciting story that, despite some flaws, was an enjoyable movie to watch."

Mark is no bad actor, just that transformers franchise never needed a no-nonsense badass guy who always tried to act tough. Shia had all the elements to retain the lightheartedness. Introduction of Mark gave the idea that the franchise is taking itself too seriously. And we have come to this.

Michael Bay directs the fifth installment in this lackluster series, starring Mark Wahlberg who would rather be anywhere else, and Anthony Hopkins who is just having fun being in a dumb popcorn movie. The plot is a jumbled mess, with era's changing and plot lines making no sense, it was clear multiple stories were just thrown together without care. The visual effects sometimes are great but overall are awful, Continuity errors with the Transformers for some reason. The aspect ratio changes nearly every shot and it's annoying, the acting is awful, the comedy is cliche and terrible. The music is alright, but utilized horribly. Optimus Prime is barely in the movie. Him being evil is lackluster and doesn't live up to what a Nemesis Prime could be. The villain is interesting but never explored. This film doesn't make sense as being apart of 4 other movies. The transformers are very good however, Peter Cullen and Frank Welker do an incredible job as Optimus Prime and Megatron. The new additions such as Isabela Moner are horribly written and not utilized well at all, there's literally a line where they ask her \"what are you doing here?!\" and she says \"I don't know!\" This movie is a guilty pleasure it's laughably bad, and I highly recommend watching this train wreck of a Transformers film."

      "review": "Transformers: The Last Knight (2017) Plot: Our world's greatest hero becomes our fiercest enemy when Optimus Prime launches a mission to save Cybertron by destroying Earth. Now Bumblebee and Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) must lead the Autobots against their former ally in the ultimate battle to save mankind from annihilation. Review: This epic movie certainly looked amazing and the attention to detail was great but from an entertainment point of view, it was a total let down. The storyline was all over the place, and the human characters became extremely annoying after a while, except for Anthony Hopkins (Sir Edmund Burton), and his reliable robot Cogman, voiced by Jim Carter. Mark Wahlberg (Cade Yeager) didn't seem like he wanted to be there most of the time, and Laura Haddock (Vivian Wembley), the Angelina Jolie lookalike, didn't suit her role. Stanley Tucci (Merlin) made me laugh and Josh Duhamel (Colonel William Lennox) played a convincing soldier but I didn't see the point to the little girl Isabela Monet (Isabella), who seemed to get in the way most of the time. Anyway, with the Autobots still at war with the Decepticons, as usual, the humans are out to capture all of the Transformers, and with Optimus Prime gone, they are all in hiding with Cade helping them to survive. Optimus Prime finds his dead home planet, Cybertron, and meets his alleged creator, Quintessa, who tells him that he needs to get Merlin's staff to absorb Earth's energy to restore their home-world. Meanwhile, Cade is given a precious mechanical talisman from a dying Autobot Knight, and while he is battling against the TRF drones, he is approached by Cogman who invites him to the UK to meet his employer, Sir Edmund Burton, who shows him the history of the Transformers and the power of the staff. To get to the staff, he needs the help of Vivian Wembley, who is a English Literature Professor and has the power to control the staff, so they set of on there mission, with Optimus Prime close behind them. Whilst battling against the TRF and Quintessa's soldiers, there is a race to get to the staff before it destroys earth. There was much thought behind the storyline but I personally thought that it was a right mess. It also lacked wit and there wasn't much depth to the various characters. With that aside, the action scenes were half decent and the transformers looked great but it wasn't enough to save the movie. I really think that they need to go back to the drawing board with this franchise, because all of the movies haven't been that great, and they seem to be getting worse. If they do decide to release another Transformers, they really need to think about character building, more than the CGI content, even though it made a decent profit at the box office. Average! Round-Up: This movie was directed by Michael Bay, who brought you the Bad Boys franchise, The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbour, The Island, The Transformers franchise, the great Pain & Gain and 13 Hours. With so many hit movies behind him, I'm not surprised of the scale of this movie but I still wasn't impressed with the outcome. The corny script and poor acting has been the main problem with the whole franchise but they all seem to make a lot of money, for some unknown reason. With another Transformers movie in the pipeline, due to be released in 2019, I hope that they choose another director for the project, who will give it a fresh concept, and hopefully a decent cast. Budget: $217million Worldwide Gross: $605.5million Genre: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Anthony Hopkins, Josh Duhamel, Laura Haddock, Santiago Cabrera, Stanley Tucci, John Turturro, Isabela Moner, Jerrod Carmichael, with the voices from Peter Cullen, John Goodman, Ken Watanabe, Jim Carter, Steve Buscemi and Omar Sy. 4/10"

      "review": "Watch genius Michael Bay explode a junkyard down your throat!! TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT I have endured many bad things in my life. However, having to watch Michael Bay self-promote himself every time I went to see an IMAX movie in the last 4 months might be one of the worse. It is the fifth movie of the franchise. Last time, I had to sit through 3 hours of a glorified toy commercial. But this time, it's different! This time it has knights! If you couldn't spot the irony in the last sentences, you might be capable of writing a screenplay for a Transformers movie, congrats! I do have to say that consistency is key and this film sits alongside Moon and Extinction to create a shiny metal catalog of what NOT to do in a movie. With next-to-rubbish performances, a latina character that since Logan can be considered token, misused nazi imagery, repulsive script with the usual dose of racism, the blatant and constant shifts in aspect ratio which wouldn't allow me to be pulled into the movie, etc, etc. The only thing I'm not as mad this time around is with the cinematography, which I have to admit as having less blues and oranges and a saturated color pallet to a more crisp image (sometimes). In a lot of ways, this film is the epitome of what can be done in visual effects as the titular creatures have never look greater. Yet, as usual, they are trapped in a movie critic's nightmare. It would be a truly out of body experience if I could turn off my brain and enjoy this film but the movie simply won't allow it. This is what happens when you give too much power to a director that likes to have it his way. Of course he'll want to shoot it from 20 different angles, he has the money to do so and absolutely no point of view to choose just one! And of course the editing is going to keep those same 20 angles because if you keep cutting, the audience will be entertained, right? What annoys me the most is that an action movie will continue to have its action overcut and disorientating in the fifth try! There is no order, no excitement and no enthrallment if you can't understand what's happening. Is cinema just noise and explosions? It seems like the original cut of this film had 3h and someone came in and said \"No, take 5 seconds out of every shot, that'll do it!\". Furthermore, Hopkins is a dud, it's revolting to see such a great actor so desperate for a fat paycheck and the whole templars/middle age storyline is so uninteresting and disconnected and it's sad that no one could have scrapped that out. In about 30 years, what movies will be chosen to tell our story? Judging from the current state of our political and social panorama, I would say that this testosterone-filled, rushed chicken feed and unimaginative piece of \"film\" might just make us justice."

The gyroscopic action because of the crumbling Chamber, the epic 'We Have To Go' song by Steve, hearing Prime and Megs original Latin American dub actors from the trilogy back into their roles after they're absence from the 4th blasting through the speakers (I watched in Spanish, yes), each and every single one of the aspects of this final fight is a monument to the amazing cinematic universe created by Michael through these 10 years and I'm hurt that Hasbro canceled all future proyects except for Bumblebee. But these films forged my love for action, special effects, epic music, explosions and of course Linkin Park. These are not to be viewed as Shakespeare proyects, never were and never will be. They're fun and entertaining movies to spend a while with your friends and family. Critics look to dismember these as 'the disasters they are' and, frankly, I also have my gripes, but they don't take away the fun factor.
