      "review": "'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is an absolute drag. The ending felt like it took hours to complete, then to make it worse (what am I chatting, more like better) it just ends on a dime without any true reaction to the mass brawl that had ensued. Bit abrupt, I thought. A lot of what I can say about this could be taken from my review of the preceding 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen', just a little bit more definitive and debilitating. I'm all for full action only, I literally love 'Fast & Furious', but even I need some characters to connect with so I can forge a desire to watch 'em - no-one here gives me that. The cast, if only on paper, is more interesting to look at, mind you. I wasn't expecting to see John Malkovich and Frances McDormand appear, the former's part fits fairly well in fairness but the latter is incredibly wasted with a rubbish character. Tyrese Gibson (eventually) features more, something I did actually wish for in the 2009 predecessor. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has a slightly better character to portray, at least when compared to what Megan Fox had to work with. Elsewhere, Ken Jeong is genuinely good in this - in fact, I'd say he is responsible for any pleasant reactions that I got during this movie, funny guy. I just caught a glimpse of the box office takings... $1.124 billion?! Bloody hell. I'm now curious to see if that translated into a positive reception from websites like this. (edit: not really, but it evidently won over the average moviegoer though, so fair enough). If only you could see my face when I realised that the next installment goes on for even closer to three (!) hours. I best load up on the snacks! Hey, who knows, maybe 'Transformers: Age of Extinction' is the 'Fast Five' of this franchise? nervous chuckle"

      "review": "The third, and should have been the last, Transformers film in the Bayverse, is surprisingly very good. It was dangerous, fun, didn‚Äôt take itself too seriously, and delved into what a full-scale war between Autobots and Decepticons would look like on Earth. With stakes that have never been higher, a so-so plot, some REALLY good music and visuals, this movie really did feel like a perfect finale for Sam Witwicky and his Autobots. This movie does have its problems, of course, and it has inconsistencies that really is very convenient for the plot to go as it did. But it still remains a guilty pleasure in my heart."

      "review": "Transformers: Dark of the Moon represents a standout moment in the franchise, combining explosive action, striking visual effects, and a deeper thematic exploration of loyalty, betrayal, and duty. Peter Cullen‚Äôs portrayal of Optimus Prime carries a weight of leadership and conviction, while Leonard Nimoy‚Äôs Sentinel Prime masterfully conveys the tragic complexity of betrayal, making their dynamic one of the most emotionally charged in the series. Hugo Weaving‚Äôs Megatron, though sidelined, still delivers a brooding, dangerous presence. Shia LaBeouf gives a solid performance as Sam, wrestling with the need to prove himself amidst chaos, and John Turturro‚Äôs Agent Simmons remains a scene-stealer, blending eccentric humor with heroic sincerity. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson further anchor the film‚Äôs human side with their portrayal of loyal soldiers, while John Malkovich as Bruce Brazos offers delightfully oddball humor, and Frances McDormand‚Äôs Director Mearing brings stern authority, grounding the film with gravitas. Despite strong performances from the cast, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley‚Äôs Carly feels shallow, serving little purpose beyond being a love interest for Sam, which detracts from the film‚Äôs emotional weight. The Autobots and Decepticons, especially Bumblebee, Wheelie, Ratchet, Ironhide, Starscream, Barricade, and Soundwave, are not only epic and cool but also inject humor into their roles, balancing fun and intensity. Visually, the film is stunning, with a seamless blend of CGI and real-world locations that still impresses today. The violence in this movie pushes the boundaries of what PG-13 can be, with moments that shockingly show robots bleeding real blood, adding to the film's intensity. The epic score enhances the emotional stakes, amplifying the film's dark and depressing tone as it explores themes of sacrifice and the heavy burdens of war. Some of Optimus Prime‚Äôs statements are strikingly intense, making the reality of these robots committing genocide and war crimes even more compelling. This makes Dark of the Moon the Bayverse‚Äôs most ambitious and satisfying installment; if only the series had ended here."

So cool to see characters like Shockwave and Sentinel Prime have a huge role in this movie, and while the ending may leave a bad taste in the mouths of many, it doesn't ruin the rest of the movie, for me at least. Go watch it or yourself. I'm going to buy a Shockwave action figure"

The more I learn about the movie the better it gets! I love seeing the details added in to these scenes.

Following Revenge of the Fallen's loud noises and explosions, dainty sexualization of female actors, retconn galore, and drowning us in multiple poor attempts at humor. For the trained eye it is migraine worthy. HOWEVER, this movie gave us things that genuinely surprised me. First off, Sentinel Prime was probably the most complex and well written villain Michael Bay gave us and allowing us to see a softer side of Optimus again with Sentinel's addition. Rather than a generic \"Humans are dumb, destroy them\" shtick. He is a more tragic person who will do whatever it takes to ensure the safety of his home.. no matter how corrupt his actions may be. This film also just radiates 'Summer Blockbuster' with all the action and battle of giant proportions, taking a unique style of tying in transformers with human history as buildup for the plot. And of course it has some of the best special effects I've seen, the entire Chicago battle featured great CGI that puts a majority of movies released in the past 7 years to shame. It had some good potential, and so decent writing in spots, however it's issues sting the whole thing in the butt like a snake in the toilet.... ok at best."

Considering the original cartoon's story was at the most two parts and forty something minute episode, this movie stretches to 2¬Ω HOUR movie. The padding involving Sam, which I think is suppose to be Spike. But they changed Spike into a whiny yelling Kenny. Makes you wonder is she really going out with him? Of course Spike's dad Sparkplug didn't come out any better. Even though I don't agree with the critics, I can see where they're coming from with these movies. It started out not perfect but still great and started sliding down quickly. But the effects are great and still better then the last one. Robots don't have balls in this one."

It pained me to watch the last third of the film - the long, spectacularly boring action sequences, neatly spaced by the villain who takes his sweet time activating his evil weapon. As I think, the first third was also indignantly awful. Five minutes into the film, when a CGI President JFK appeared on-screen, I nearly puked. The horrible character dialogue, involving a catastrophically misused Shia LaBeouf, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, and Ken Jeong, almost had me walk out. The unfortunate thing with the Transformers franchise is that however much character development that director Michael Bay puts into the film, the humans' overall input into the actual fighting is negligible. Once Bay fixes this gigantic problem, he can then possibly give some reconciliation to the underpaid critics who were forced to sit through this awful film."

(#1 being the first movie) The action in this movie is probably some of the best action I've ever seen in a film. There is a lack of emotion in the story however, especially the love plot between Sam and his new girlfriend. We've been building the relationship between Sam and Mekayla, and then she's just gone, which is kinda weird. However, I was brought to tears during the autobot execution scene. So that was good. Also, the building fight scene is absolutely awesome! It is its own mini movie, with a beginning, (the building starting to fall,) a middle, (the decepticon in the building) and an end, (Shockwaves worm attacking.) Optimus Prime going full melay on Megatron and Sentinel Prime in the end was a bit out of character, And I think the original ending where he only killed Sentinel and had Megatron leave earth instead of killing him would've been better. But overall, a great movie. I would definitely watch it again, and I recommend you watch it as well."

Writing is also perfect. This is one of the best movie story's/plot's I've ever seen. Casting is great. Adventure was good. Characters, although we didn't get much of him I really liked Mirage. I love the ending Prime leaves us of with another perfect speech that makes him one of the best leaders in sci-fic history. And I think this is a great way to have a humans vs robots apocalypse.

The acting isn't that good outside of Frances McDermond who is decent. Shia feels like he is so over the top at times and lacks any charm or chemistry being not as good as 1 or even 2. The new love interest is better than Megan Fox but not by much, I still think she is average at best. The Autobots really don't have any personality and like all the other side characters are one dimensional. Tyrese Gibson & Duhamel are as one dimensional as they were in the previous one. Ken Jeong is TERRIBLE. My main problem is the editing and pacing are not good. The first half of this film is unfocused and overall bloated. The plot feels like it is a Political Thriller that is so ridiculous a setup its laughable at times. The whole backstory with Sam trying to find a job, the plot twist with his girlfriends boss and the fake out with the space shuttle is ridiculous. The film does become more stable by the end in the Battle for Chicago which has all he classic Bay Tropes but its at least simple and straightforward unlike the first half which helps somewhat. The cinematography is ok enough, there is a complete oversaturation of CGI and isn't anywhere as good as the first. None of the locations outside of Chicago are that memorable. The music is generic and boring as well. Let me say this, if you liked Rise of the Fallen you'll like this. If not than skip it, its pretty much the same thing."

Just all that with the robo-action and the stupid hilarious of the film make it really fun to watch, if you can handle that sort of stuff."

I remember the toys and the memories I had with others. I still enjoy the other films, but this is one that stands out the most and I will never forget it. It astounds me much more that it is one of the highest-grossing films of all time, with making almost 1.2 billion dollars in the box office despite a \"low\" budget of 195 million dollars. I had no idea what to expect after Revenge of the Fallen, but this caught me completely off guard. Everything in Dark of the Moon is out of this world, the characters, the musical score, the story, the mystery, the action, the intensity, everything compelled me. You need to see this movie and when you do you'll find out something that you definitely never saw coming, I know I never did."

The bad reviews can only be explained by the fact that some reviewers tend to criticize the story for not having a deeper meaning. But who needs a story like that in a sci-fi action movie about alien invasion. I think that The fans have been largely served and there is really not much to criticize here. The only thing that is missing is Megan Fox. But Rosie Huntington-Whiteley honestly did a good job. So if you liked the first one in the franchise and you don't go in with much expectations, you are most likely to enjoy this one. It's a great entertainment!"

The main poster for the film has Shockwave on the cover but he's barley in it, literally only 30 seconds tops. Megan Fox is also replaced by another women who's character could be compared to a slice of plain bread. MAN! They even got the names wrong with some of the robots, for example, The robot that they named Sentinel is actually Alpha Trion from the original cartoon show, and he is NOTHING like this character. In fact, he is the reason that Optimus Prime exists. You think that they would use Unicorn or something that makes more sense to a Transformer plot. Michel Bay just threw another Transformers film together without having any knowledge on what Transformers is or was. I wish i could give this film a zero star because it killed my love for transformers."

Boy was that a mistake. Despite a host of excellent actors brought on to support the returning cast, nobody could rise above a script so abjectly hopeless with a director to match. The only redeeming aspect is the quality action visuals, and its clear that if they couldn't squeeze some slow-mo into a scene they weren't concerned with how it looked; JFK looks like the prop department raided a fire-damaged Madame Tussaud's. The story and dialogue are so incredibly juvenile that it is almost painful; the narrative builds up a somewhat compelling and morally gray villain, only to have him undone by Megatron's ego, stupidity, and incredible short-sightedness. The comedy is poorly timed and stupid. There are a strange series of bizarre musical features. Friendly reminder: this was the 5th highest grossing film of all time at its peak. (1/5)"

But overall, the editing and pacing is epileptic and lurching like a kangarooing car. The 3D varies but the spottiness, lack of consistency and disregard for 3D framing makes it almost negligible if not the for the utterly bright, crisp photography unhindered completely by 3D.

What makes this movie standout however compared to its subsequent new movies is Steve Jablonsky's score of music. Managing to give both highly emotional and dramatic orchestra, only adding to the scenes giving them nothing but pure emotion.

Transformers: Dark of the Moon, in my opinion, is a prime example of this. I am not someone who hates Michael Bay, nor am I someone who will take shits on his movies just because they're his movies. Say what you will about how he crafts stories, whether good or bad, he is excellent at incorporating special effects and sound design into his films. And, with this movie, it actually seems like he tried to make a good movie, and in my opinion, he did. This movie is extremely entertaining, badass, epic and technically well-assembled. Even the story, while convoluted as hell, seems more cohesive than the other Transformers movies (except maybe the first one). The first Transformers and this one are the two ones I genuinely love, but I think DOTM is the superior one."

      "review": "Still another awful Bayformers sequel. Dark of the Moon is better than Revenge of the Fallen, but it is still an awful movie. The lame humans still annoyingly hog up too much screentime. The character development for the Transformers is horrible. Shockwave was an horribly disappointing villain and was treated like shit. Shockwave? More like Shitwave. I can never forgive Michael Bay for what he did to Shockwave. Bay raped Shockwave and turned him into a mumbling pussy who barely talks that doesn't really pose a major threat. Frank Welker was severely miscast as the voice of Shockwave. Shockwave's voice was terrible. He was also badly cast as the voice of Soundwave. Steve Blum should've been Shockwave's voice actor. In the third act, he was horribly and embarrassingly getting killed by a bunch of human soliders!!! WTF Michael Bay? Shockwave ended up losing and dying because of a stupid parachute! I'm not kidding, one of the human soldiers skydived and activated his parachute and accidentally got his parachute tangled around Shockwave when he was shooting (I honestly didn't even know what the hell he was shooting at because of Bay's god-awful camerawork) which stupidly somehow caused him to get disoriented. Then a bunch of explosions literally came out of nowhere near Shockwave severely damaging him. Then another human soldier lands on Shockwave's shoulder and shoots a sticky detonator on his mouth. Then the sticky detonator blows up some of Shockwave's mouth off causing him to scream in agony. Then a bunch of human soldiers were spraying hundreds of bullets at him from inside a building while he was still getting bombarded by countless explosions. Then the Wreckers were shooting bullets at him too and damaging him to the point where his eyeball was loose and started falling off. Then Shockwave screamed \"mommy\" and got shot from a bunch of more human soldiers shooting explosives at him with their grenade launchers. Then Optimus Prime finally comes and finishes Shockwave off and kills him. Describing Shockwave's death was just PAINFUL. Starscream dies from another stupid, cheap, and unfair death too. Starscream's death was arguably the worst death in the entire movie and not just the entire movie...but also the worst death in the entire Bayformers franchise! Starscream ends up dying by the hands of fucking Sam Witwicky!!! Seriously, MIchael Bay? WTF is wrong with you? It was the stupidest, corniest, most disappointing, and most embarrassing death ever! Then Soundwave's death was the least bad, but still a badly executed death. He gets killed all because he got distracted by a falling ship being torn apart and destroyed by two tiny robots. Bumblebee suddenly does sort of a roundhouse-like kick on Soundwave and then soon decapitates him by shooting his head off from inside his chest. Soundwave's voice wasn't even right. Soundwave is supposed to be speak with no emotions like he always did in the G1 series. The voice performance for Soundwave did not fit his character. Then Sentinel Prime (who ends up being the real main villain of the film) dies because Megatron shoots him a bunch of times when he wasn't looking while he was about to kill Optimus by stabbing him with his sword. So Megatron beats up Sentinel when he least expected it and breaks off his helmet. So Megatron unintentionally saved Optimus' life from Sentinel. Then Optimus gets up with only one arm and ends up easily and quickly killing Megatron by ripping his head off with his sword. Megatron was such an idiot. If he hadn't hurt Sentinel then Optimus would've died and his plan to rebuild their home planet Cybertron by taking all of Earth's resources and technology would have succeeded. Bay ruined Megatron. Megatron barely did anything in this movie. So after Megatron dies, Optimus ends up killing Sentinel by shooting his head with Megatron's weapon. All of the Decepticons and Sentinel Prime died in cheap and unfair ways. The only good thing about this movie was the great soundtrack. Rating: 3/10"

Amongst all the CGI carnage our human protagonists somehow don't get squashed by falling buildings or evil Decepticons, and the supposedly heroic Optimus Prime slices up his enemies with much relish (\"We will kill them all!\" he exclaims at one point). The never-ending battle sequences here will test the patience of even the biggest Transformers fan."

However, I wouldn't judge his films because of that. The guy clearly is talented, extremely so. Quite possibly the best action director there is. My problem with him is the same problem I have with most of America. The masses are quite dumb and no depth to them. So goes the typical Michael Bay film. It's remarkable how someone so visually talented has absolutely no ability to actually convey any realistic emotion or make you feel at all for a character. Just very surface portrayals. All that being said, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is his best Transformers film. He even tells a much better story than either of his previous Transformers films, or any of his other non-Transformers films, for that matter. The action is not just good, it's freaking spectacular. The amount of detail and realism in his action is absolutely unmatched. This was definitely what a summer film is supposed to be. Considering I've seen every blockbuster this year so far, the action in this film surpass the others by miles. As a Transformers fan as a kid, seeing Shockwave and Laserbeak play such prominent roles had my 11 year old pants on fire! Sadly, though, the nearly-40 year-old in me was critical of the unnecessary length, the gratuitous/immature language and the vapid ending. However, it all depends on what you are looking for in a summer film and, if it's what most people want, I would highly recommend it. It will definitely satisfy the masses and impress budding filmmakers."

An improvement over the mostly awful \"yet-I-felt-the-need-to-give-it-two-point-five-stars-out-of-generosity\" Revenge of the Fallen. Michael Bay may be a director who feasts upon the money he makes out of all of you but at least he listens to your complaints when he wants to. He gets rid of the racist twins from the last movie and gives Optimus Prime more screen time. It's overlong, yes. It's story isn't any different. The Decepticons wanting to do bad things to humanity because they're belived to be beyond saving. Megan Fox's replacement is not more than an attractive damsel in distress. Yet this time, it actually entertains. The special effects are as impressive as always, the action sequences are mind-blowingly awesome with a lot better execution than in the repetitive ones in RotF and there's some really great shots. Makes me wish I could've seen the movie back in 2011 in 3D. You know, when 3D was still worth your while. There are some really cool shots that must've been amazing to see in the third dimension. Perhaps the best performances are from the robots rather than the actual humans but this one still manages to pack in enough entertainment value to cover its exhaustingly overlong running time. This one could appear one day, on a Top 10 list of my favourite Michael Bay movies. And I mean that as in either as a director or as a producer. However, that day is yet to come."

But fun fact: this film had 3 actors that passed away unfortunately: Leonard Nimoy, Franscsco Quinn and George Coe. I kind of liked Dino/Mirage in the movie. Que/Wheeljack however though really bothering me. Bay made him from one of the most bad*** scientists into an Einstein stereotype; I don't mean to disrespect George Coe who voiced Que, but Bay did choose a poor decision to insult one of our favorite G1 Autobots and turn him into Robo-Einstein-esc guy. And people are going to disagree, but I LOVE Sentinel Prime in this movie. Yes he killed Ironhide, be also killed Skids and Mudflap in the comics along with him. His voice and design is great and even his fire truck alt mode is cool. And yet the Wreckers were pretty enjoyable characters too. But one thing I didn't like in the movie is HOW BAY TREATED SHOCKWAVE!!! This guy appeared as an easter egg in ROTF, AND YET BAY JUST POINTLESSLY ADDED HIM INTO THE MOVIE, and as a result, HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING IN THE MOVIE EXCEPT SHOOTING OPTIMUS AND TANGLING HIM IN WIRES, and of course, DIE!!! He didn't even attack Chernobyl, he just had his pet worm to DO ALL THE WORK FOR HIM!!! SCREW YOU MICHAEL BAY, YOU PIECE OF-alright I'll stop now. Overall, the movie was OK."

The action and story is good with hardly a dull moment after it reaches the half way point. The movie has quite a few emotional scenes that are executed well, with the exception of a couple containing Sam and his new girlfriend we don't care about. Tone and pacing is a bit of an issue at some points as well, but it doesn't hold the movie back too much. It has a lot of flaws, but is very enjoyable. It makes for a better movie than Revenge of the Fallen and has more Transformer action than the first one of the series."

That's totally fine, and there's certainly plenty here to allow all that as Michael Bay delivers yet more mindless action and huge spectacle-sequences backed up by a great score from Steve Jablonsky. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Sadly though, copy and paste is yet again all that these movies are by now, and that's all they deserve in return as every installment emulates all the flaws and dull-ness of its predecessor. As a result, there's again absolutely nothing to engage you here - the characters are vastly under-written and have less life than the robots that dominate the screen (which really is saying something), the story is an over-serious and terribly complicated maze of un-interesting sub-plots that noone really cares about, and the product placement of actual products is almost as startling as the placement of women, who may as well be 'products' in the eyes of the film itself. As a result, you'll end up truly disengaged, uninterested and slightly wincing as the film proceeds for the entirety of its hugely overlong run-time here. VERDICT: Another exceedingly dull and uninteresting film for me; 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is exactly the same as its predecessor. Come on Michael Bay, you can do better than this."

Although the \"twist\" wasn't exactly deadly given away, it was pretty evident early in the film what's really going down: it's just matter of how and when. Unfortunately, that 1.5 hour-ish point is precisely where the action and plot decide to go completely barmy. Gone is the averagely welcome, and here is where the rubber meets the road: hackneyed, ugly, and absurd action scenes join laughably pathetic plot elements that swarm the viewer in droves, dragging down what could have been an otherwise acceptable movie. It's downright hideous, and seems to have been thrown in simply for the expressed purpose of filling the last 60 or so minutes of the movie. I could honestly weep for the poor souls that think this movie is at all representative of the qualities found in the Transformers franchise, even the comics. If you don't \"have to see\" this movie, then don't. You won't regret missing it."

      "review": "The third installment in the series is noticeably better than the second, even if it still faces similar problems that have continually plagued this franchise. Shia LaBeouf returns as Sam Witwicky in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. When a mysterious event from Earth's past erupts into the present day it threatens to bring a war to Earth so big that the Transformers alone will not be able to save us. The \"Transformers\" franchise has faced its ups and downs, albeit mostly downs. But with the third installment, they looked to change a few things up. If anything, all of those changes were really positive overall, but the writers still don't know how to capture that essence of these fun, alien robots and there's still something missing. Although it was a good step in the right direction for this franchise, there's still a lot of work to be done. Shia LaBeouf returns for the final time, reprising his role as Sam. As a a fan first and \"critic\" second, I still claim that Shia is a great actor. Although the roles and films he's been in aren't the brightest, it doesn't take away the fact that he's a great actor with a lot of talent. This is someone who can capture that emotional intensity of a role while really bringing out the true nature of the character at hand. I absolutely love Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, as she's a huge step up from Megan Fox. Not that Megan Fox is terrible, but she certainly wasn't the best. Hearing them cast a Victoria Secret Model as the leading female role raised some eyebrows, but she's a pretty decent actress overall and she was utilized much better than Fox's character was. John Turturro was still overused in this film and was much more of an annoyance than a help. His character is still annoying and bratty and he really serves no purpose. They do bring back the crew of Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, which is a nice continuity aspect for these films. The special effects, like always, are still fantastic. Despite the ridiculous overuse of firework explosions in random places, you still have to admit that everything looks fantastic. Everything from the transformers to the action, it all looks fantastic. This is a perfect example of the epicness that sci-fi movies should look like, and it's one of the strongest attributes the franchise has held. The story is a bit better than the previous film, but still a bit overdone and unfathomable at times. I mean, come on, bringing an entire planet over to Earth? How does that even work? How does that solve anything?? Minor spoiler there I guess, sorry. But despite some of those head-scratchers, I like how the story feels darker than any of the previous films. Even the trailers gave off this extremely dark vibe and although the film never really captured that, I liked the slight adjustment in tone. In the end, there's not much to say about this movie because I would just be repeating what I said about the other films. I feel like at this point, it's just how these movies execute because they all have very similar problems and very similar positives. I did enjoy this more than the second film but not more than the first, and that has to be some sort of consolidation. If you're a fan of the franchise, you'll like this movie. If not, this movie won't offer anything new and will probably just run your patience down to zero."

What is the gorgeous girl doing outside of a calendar or a ramp? Watching the graphics expertise makes me feel like a crazy amount of money, talent, time and effort is being drained down in the wrong hole. The VFX work is sophisticated, complex and involves heavy planning, thinking and execution effort and in my opinion Michael Bay would go a long way and win many hearts if he can try just being a visual effects supervisor. Really the work here is much better than Avatar or Avengers. Synopsis: Fox is replaced by another hottie. Characters from the previous editions reprise same roles and dialogues. Nobody know what Decepticons are fighting for and Autobots are like overstayed guests. With a long list of mechanical characters, Bay tried to bring in the entire Hollywood to elevate the missing aesthetic value like Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Ken Jeong, John Turturo etc. Instead of utilizing their special talents to arrive at a fresh flavor, all these talented actors succumb to buffoonery along with the rest of the cast. The robots behave more human than the actual actors themselves which is another thing that makes me cringe. There is actually a weird scene where a division captain instructs his team to hold fire until he commands, while actually all of them are shooting.

Sam Witwicki (Shia LaBeouf) and the Autobots must join together with their human friends and fight against the gathering darkness to defend our world from the Decepticons all-consuming evil plan to enslave the human race once and for all! Ok, so this chapter in the Transformers saga wasn't too bad. It was action-packed and had a great backstory! Why exactly did the US want to get to the moon back in the 1960's so badly? The answer was pretty cool. But one thing that I didn't care for was how unrealistic it was that Sam's \"new\" girlfriend, Carly Miller (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), never got a speck of dirt, sweat, blood, or grime of any kind on her bright white outfit---even though everyone around her is absolutely covered in it! I know that Huntington-Whiteley is a model, but come on!"

Mark Wahlberg is fairly decent and the transformers still look amazing but I think it's about time they stopped this franchise now. Unfortunately with the return of Megatron/Galvatron it looks unlikely. The two saving graces of this movie were the always awesome Stanley Tucci and the dinobots. It could have been a decent film but it the plot was too convoluted and it was far too long!"

Thank god Megan Fox left, but we have a replacement as for Sam's girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Lens flares, oversaturation and unnecessary camera spin filled with tedious script and incoherent (yet somehow manageable) plot. Do I recommend it? If you're a fan of Michael Bay's Transformers, then go ahead. You'll love it better than the second one. But for those of us who love the toys and the real cartoons, it won't do it better. It'll worsen your imagination. Grade: D+ Percentage: 20% Rating: 1,5/5"

But I guess the fact that I look at the rating plus most of the reviews for not just this Transformers movie but all of them and I cant seem to figure out why they are so disliked. To me they are action movies made for the sole purpose of showing off special effects and entertaining me and they do both of these things really well. Is Shia LaBeouf a tool and a bad actor ? Yes. Is the movie oversaturated with digital green screen effects ? Yes. But really, what did you expect ? Its a movie about robots transforming themselves at the drop of a hat into different automobiles of course it is going to be pounded with special effects and digital technology. I honestly could care less about the script and the acting and the overall story, to me Transformers Dark of the Moon entertains the hell out of me and is a great action packed movie. I thought this one was the best of the series, in fact, I'm totally opposite, I think the later ones are the better ones and the first one is the worst of them all. Just goes to show you how everyone has different taste."

On the other hand thow we have some very good casting choices such as Leonard Nemoy as Sentinal prime and a cast member from fire fly. The character that has become remotely interesting is the character Epps and other characters like Optimus Prime, bumble bee and megaton have redeemed them selfs and the action sequences are spectacular and not tome nation the final fight scene between Optimus Prime and Sentinal a Prime is awsome. While Dark of the moon manages to fix some of the issues from the Transformers 2 it unfortunately is still a bad movie but way better than Transformers 2"

When a mysterious event from Earth's past erupts into the present day it threatens to bring a war to Earth so big that the Transformers alone will not be able to save us. First of all, DOTM is not good movie. However, it is better than ROTF but not by much. Again, it is the exact same thing as the others. But, the difference is Megan Fox is no longer in the picture. We have Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who is Fox's replacement because apparently Fox herself compared Michael Bay to Adolf Hitler. And no, Huntington-Whiteley isn't any better. What can I say about DOTM? I mean I can't hate it because it slightly better than ROTF which I despise very much. Like ROTF, the long, bloated time (which is two hours and thirty-four by the way is WAY too long for a film about nothing) just makes the film more tedious. But, the difference is that DOTM is slightly more fun (not really fun) than ROTF but that is not saying much. The action is pretty good like in the last films although it is really repetitive and tedious. The effects are good also but they can't save this film from being tedious and cliched.

I miss Megan Fox, and this is the first of many characters that will leave because of many reasons, not because Bay doesn't want them in the story, but because they don't want to be there. This one is that same as the others, and by now I feel like I can write one review and it could be for all of them. The story is one of massive scale, and so are the battles, like a robot version of Battle: LA. It's just so over the top though, sometimes it's cool, but it's too much. This movie is 90% CGI, watch the trailer and you will know. You will also know that the decepticons teleport from inside the moon, to Chicago to start a giant battle which destroys the whole city basically. Our new enemy is Dark of the Moon, or maybe just Dark I'm not sure, finally a bad guy that can stand up against Prime in a fair battle, yet we still don't really get to see any. The beginning gives us more depth to the Transformers origins, yet not really explaining much, other than how there is a ship on the moon, but not how there is a whole army waiting inside the moon. The final battle is massive, cool but dumb as well, over the top, and is a mess of CGI, explosions, slow motion, and rubble. The alien worm eating the building was cool, but there's no way anyone inside would have survived. This is also the first Transformers movie to feature human soldiers actually being able to do something against the robots, maybe too much though. Overall kinda a mess, way to much to complain about to go into much detail, just watch the trailer and you will know what it's about, but even if you watch it you will not fully understand what's going on."
