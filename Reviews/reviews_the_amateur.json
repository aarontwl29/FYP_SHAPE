Solid performances all around and more suspenseful than I expected. Still, I wanted to read the original novel before reviewing the movie and I‚Äôm glad I did; the original book delves more into why the blackmail works that wasn‚Äôt explored enough in the movie. (No spoilers; let‚Äôs just say that what a writer would consider enough to blackmail top CIA officials in the 70s is called Tuesday in the 21st century‚Äôs CIA!ü§£) Good enough for a widescreen tv but I was impressed with the‚Äôbig screen experience.‚Äù"

The Amateur is about a pencil neck, computer geek working for the CIA who becomes an International CIA Agent overnight in order to find and kill those who killed his wife. Sounds stupid? You‚Äôre right. It is. It was. Somehow over a 2 hour period Rami Malek, an academy award winner, is transformed into a bullet proof CIA spy using his skills he learned from Lawrence Fishburne over a period of a few days and the help of YouTube videos (seriously). Jon Berthnal has a couple of very regrettable appearances, seriously, just a couple. Needless to say Rami learns how to hack into every building, access every camera, to evade the highly trained CIA agents sent to find him. He is bulletproof. Literally escaping a Seal team with automatic weapons. Ugh. It is just so cringe worthy. I feel more stupider just writing this. This was crap. Just total crap. A waste of 2 hours and a free movie ticket. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money watching this stupidity."

It was slow in some parts, I felt like they could have used this time to do more character development or even make the story a bit more complex. They could have done more will the main character's skill set to make the plot more unique. There was a random CIA character in the beginning that showed up later and then disappeared, didn't have any actual role in the story.. kind of odd, a missed opportunity perhaps. Rami Malek and most of the actors deliver, but I can't say the same for the movie's writing."

He manages to eliminate three out of the four people responsible for her death. When he finally confronts the main culprit in the climax, rather than exacting personal justice, he turns the killer over to the government. It‚Äôs an odd choice that feels unearned and anticlimactic, leaving viewers wondering, Why? The movie lacks suspense, the plot doesn‚Äôt fully come together, and it ultimately falls short of its potential. It might have worked better as a straight-to-streaming release rather than a theatrical experience."

Even Liam Neeson doesn't need to make any more of those stupid revenge movies! There are some smart bits (thus the half-star), but what kind of entitled idiot thinks he's got the right to go out and kill people because a loved one dies? Or that he even has a chance to actually succeed?? I would not buy that Rami Malik could do any of this, or that anyone with a brain would want to try. Lastly, the idea that everyone in the CIA is ethically and morally good except for a few bad apples is possibly the most insulting bit of all.

The first 5 minutes showcase stiff and unemotional acting from Rachel Brosnahan and Rami Malek. Thankfully we don't see them on the screen together after this, but they packed enough clich√©s and cheesy dialogue to make up for it. Each line felt like it was just being remembered not acted. The rest of the movie feels similar. We are introduced to a cast of characters, foes, villains and allies who end up being pretty much inconsequential throughout the whole movie. Even the characters who seem like they would be very important seem to only suggest their importance and then maybe appear once more in the movie for almost no reason - John Bernthal's characters being the biggest sinner here. The movie hints he's a pretty friendly but badass agent who Rami Malek is perhaps envious of, or wants to be pals with. He turns up later not for a cool action scene, not too bring Malek on and be defeated in some cool way, not to join Malek and lend him his very cool agent skills - but just to tell the guy to give it up, and the conversation simply ends because Malek says 'nah', so Bernthal let's him walk away. That's it. It's a tiny scene in the middle of the movie, and we never see that character again. Laurence Fishburn also has an extremely disappointing lack of screen time; his story line is seriously confusing and lacks development - he is introduced to train our character, after which he follows our character as if he's trying to turn him in, he suddenly saves our character by what seems like betraying the CIA, he turns up at the end to say 'well done protagonist, you proved me wrong and you really are the coolest guy'. We have no understanding why or when he decided to help Rami Malek considering Malek was getting away from him the whole beginning of the film. The actual villains that Malek is trying to find are all of course foreign, and also not a threat at all. The most stakes there was at any point is with the woman he went after first because she scratched his face up a bit before being hit by s car, conveniently. The rest of his revenge killings just kind of happen, there is no trouble travelling, no trouble finding the baddies, no fighting and barely any negotiating. The final villain which is corruption at the CIA also just is fixed at the end, and despite us knowing thet betrayed and killed allies abroad secretly, we are reassured that patriotism and the American dream will prevail after all."

I was a little disappointed with the use of John Bernthal's character, which they seemed to be hinting at him having a larger role later but (spoiler) that does not really happen. The final sequence is also a little less than satisfying and again unbelievable (Malek's character is never shut out of the CIA infrastructure so he can do a lot of unbelievable things but given the plot, he would have been immediately locked out)."

I heard bad things about it, but I didn't care, because I tend to like these kind of movies. Unfortunately the movie is boring for the most part. The story is simple, the tension was on a very low level. The only thing that surprised me was the way the main character did what he did. A big part of my problems is because of the trailer. There is just too much in it and I've seen it in the cinema too many times. So in many scenes I knew what would happen. The characters are not well-written. I couldn't get attached to Heller, so that's also a big part of why I was bored. A movie like this should be a lot more tense, there were only a few intense or exciting scenes. The film should also be a lot shorter. The score is good, but a bit too epic sometimes. Finally the casting is the best aspect. The supporting cast including Jon Bernthal, Laurence Fishburne, Holt McCallany and Caitriona Balfe elevated their scenes very much. The Amateur was promising because of its cast, but ended up being boring and uninteresting."

You might want more of Inquiline played by Caitriona Balfe. Her piece is perhaps some of the most intriguing and could have (maybe should have) been the substance of dual heroes. And you might leave disappointed that Jon Bernthal's character is seemingly some sort of red herring. What the heck was that all about? The ending with Laurence Fishburne is fairly unsatisfying. And you might feel like the character played by Adrian Martinez should have had something more. The filming and scene cuts almost make you believe that certainly there will be, and then there isn't. But, it's a clever story with decent action and an interesting twist on the Jason Bourne-espe type thriller from a conspiracy perspective."

      "rating": "3.5/5",
      "review": "The film tells the story of Charlie Heller, played by Rami Malek, whom you may know, among others, from Mr. Robot or Bohemian Rhapsody. The main character works at the CIA headquarters in Langley as an extremely talented cryptologist. His seemingly simple and routine life changes completely when his wife Sarah (Rachel Brosnahan) is killed in a terrorist attack in London. Charlie does everything to convince his superiors to take action to catch and punish the perpetrators, but when they refuse you, he decides to take matters into his own hands. He uses his intelligence and skills to do justice to his beloved's killers. The plot may seem simple, predictable and give the impression of \"I've seen it somewhere before\", but it still draws you in and encourages you to follow the further fate of the characters. The pace of the film is a bit slow, but in my case it didn't make me bored - on the contrary, the story engaged me more and more. It can be said that this is a \"one-man army action\" film, but it differs from classic examples of this type. Charlie is not John Wick or Nathan Cain from Novocaina - he cannot kill a man with his bare hands. Instead of brute force, he uses his mind, knowledge and analytical skills, which adds freshness to the film. Rami Malek here is somewhat reminiscent of Elliot from Mr. The robot, although in this role, is more human - not cold and feelingless, but frightened, incapable of violence, but ready to sacrifice. It is worth mentioning that Jon Bernthal appears in the film and in my opinion his character does not play a major role. He appears maybe in three scenes and that's it. Laurence Fishburne plays a character somewhat reminiscent of Morpheus from The Matrix or King Bowery from John Wick, although here he plays rather a villain - although whether he is really bad can be debated. To be honest, it's hard for me to point out the disadvantages of this film that I didn't notice them because I was too absorbed in the plot. In short: I really liked the movie. To sum up - The Amateur is an interesting action thriller. It may seem like something we've already seen somewhere, but it's still worth giving it a chance and watching it, whether in the cinema or at home. I recommend."

      "review": "The Amateur is nothing new, but I found a good amount of fun to be had in this engaging revenge story. Rami Malek steals the show as he gives a great performance that shows the deep grief his character goes through, and I enjoyed the ways he would squirm out of tough situations like a bar of soap. It was cool seeing the way of how the film uses technology to decode the mystery of who made Rami Malek‚Äôs character a living hell, which made the action so much more fun. But I think the film takes too long for that to happen, and in the meantime we are fed a lot of different characters I found a little bland, lots of head scratching decisions made in the development of the supporting roles. Even with Rami Malek‚Äôs character, the film felt like they didn‚Äôt know how to keep his motives steady. But I think it‚Äôs an engaging enough time to watch go see it in theatres"
