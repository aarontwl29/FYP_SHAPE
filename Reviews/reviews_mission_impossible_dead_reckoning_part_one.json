      "review": "Watching Rogue Nation it seemed to me that Cruise and McQuarrie had decided to turn the franchise into something more like modern Bond, and if so they nailed it. However they over did it with Fallout making the story too convoluted and are on the same trajectory here. The Venice sequence was excellent but the night club scene looked too much like John Wick. The climax starts off OTT with Ethan paragliding onto a moving train by crashing through the exact window he needed to in order to take out the bad guy. Then it ends by copying the video game Uncharted 3, it's a great sequence but a blatant rip-off. Overall it makes for a movie that feels entertaining, enjoyable and disappointing at the same time. That said, it doesn't ruin my theory that the odd numbered MI movies are the best."

Seemingly know how to please 90% of Rotten Tomatoers so they have that going for them.. but for me and hopefully the discerning movie lover .. But overall .. too convoluted, too much vfx.. endless list of things that don’t make sense. Why is she dressed like a buccaneer? Why wouldn’t they use blue contact lenses after going to the trouble of making a mask? Why does the bad guy arbitrarily have to kill one of Ethan’s love interests? Why did he choose that haircut? Why does the fake bomb ask Benji a load of riddles?? no callbacks to that whatsoever!! Why are they going to Innsbruck?? What on earth is in Innsbruck? A little light skiing maybe? Needless to say.. atrocious acting from almost everyone. And too much plot to enjoy any characters.. shoehorning in a little relationship stuff isn’t enough. I just didn’t care about any of the characters.. such a waste. I’d have cut that CG car chase and the ridiculous sword fighting sequence just so they could have an argument! and a real moment if intimacy perhaps! I think this film and many others are the victim of having too much money .. I hope someone offers up a new story closer to the original Mission Impossible, which was so impossibly cool, iconic and simple. LOVED the spy tradecraft.. break a lightbulb in a jacket.. YES!!! loved the intrigue.. loved the realness. This has now all become too slick and high tech. And finally.. please stop with all the trailers!!! Spoiler HELL!!! We can’t enjoy anything any more!! The joy of a good surprise is a crestfallen ghost of the past.."

      "review": "First, let’s address the obvious. Tom Cruise definitely has a type. Every single romantic interest or possible romantic interest in these movies are always brunettes. Every single potential foil, foe or enemy is always blonde. Don’t know if there’s more to it than that, but it’s something I’ve noticed over the years. The movie started off a bit odd with an opening sequence that really doesn’t get explained until halfway through the movie. Your left wondering if you miss something for the first 30 minutes of the movie. The usual names and faces are there and you can feel the comfort with the character as you settle in to watch the first half of the finale. One of the so-called twist about halfway through the movie was so obvious that I was surprised they followed through with it. Sad to see a character go to go in the way that they did. Also, as a sidenote, I’m disappointed Michelle Monahan doesn’t make an appearance in this or the final movie. With the amount of times that she’s been found, wouldn’t she have been better off staying with Ethan than doing all of these spy tactics just to be found anyway anyways? Even though the action sequences were great, they weren’t as adventurous or extreme as they have been in previous movies. Not to take away from what they were or the people who performed them, it just didn’t have the same level of excitement and suspense as some of the others did. Any two part movie always seems to fall flat, because the first part is always setting up the second part. It’s no different here, but I’m looking forward to finishing the saga as we approach the second part of the finale."

      "review": "\"Dead Reckoning\" delivers exactly what you’d expect from a Mission: Impossible movie — and that’s a good thing. Tom Cruise is once again in peak Tom form, sprinting, shouting dramatically, pulling off jaw-dropping stunts, and somehow still looking younger than me (and I’m in my 40s!). You get it all: exotic locations, diabolical political intrigue, high-speed car chases, layers of mystery, a touch of tragedy and romance, and action by the truckload. The soundtrack is a standout too, melodically playing off the mood of the slower scenes and ramping up the tension when needed. Bring on the Final Reckoning — though honestly, between you and me, I wouldn’t be surprised if Cruise's Ethan Hunt is still pulling off stunts in his 90s, racing down a mountain in a turbo-charged wheelchair, saving the world."

Christopher McQuarrie expertly balanced the longer storyline that crosses two films with the demand for action and excitement on screen. The pace of the developing plot felt slow, but the action held the attention consistently. With each new installment, I am pleasantly surprised and entertained by this film series, particularly McQuarrie's work in the last few films (Rogue Nation, Fallout, and now Dead Reckoning). The plot and action sequences are original, yet still feel classic, and we repeatedly see all new things with each film. CONTINUE READING ON LETTERBOXD: https://boxd.it/60WxI5"

This story line was a busy melee of characters chasing after a phantasmic AI/weapon thingy, but really they were chasing a weak plot and superficial human dynamics. Reference the plot, how does an AI, stuck on sunken submarine under the Arctic ice sheet, manage to bridge the \"Air Gap\" on to the world-wide web to create such dread and havoc? There was supposedly some dialogue to explain this but it was too convoluted to make this \"threat\" seem relatable or concerning. For the human element, the emotional dynamics seemed like token jestures and generally unconvincing. As an example, is Tom Cruise really a credible romantic interest for the leading ladies? All I see is them doing the heavy lifting by showing vulnerability or emanting their attraction. He's responds like a Pinnochio, wooden and stilted. Sufficed to say, I am no convert to Tom Cruise's version of the James Bond franchise and couldn't finish this one even with only the last act to go. And, I am not holding my breath for the next one, which presumably there is going to be a lot of that happening on a sunken sub."

      "review": "This movie has its good moments, fun stunts and a few entertaining sequences, but is marred by astoundingly bad writing. The beginning in particular is bogged down by so much exposition you could show it in film class to teach exactly how not to handle your info-dumps. The \"Entity\" as a villain lacks credibility as an imminent threat, and makes moments like the stand-off in Venice dull and hard to digest. Hardened criminals and spies cowering before a warbling screen and its (very dull and obnoxious) human marionette? Just no. Vague threats in a business built on deceit and violence are a hard sell. Especially when you already hold enough tools to eliminate the problem, literally in the room. So Alanna's choice ends up making little sense, and this detracts from any impact Ilsa's (unnecessary) death has on the audience (the sword fight is another odd choice, plot armour for Gabriel more than anything entertaining). To add insult to injury, comparing Ilsa to Grace as a \"person Ethan cares about who has to die\" is also a painful stretch, unless Ethan Hunt has the emotional depths of a puppy, falling in love with anything new he happens to meet. Not to mention how the \"disposable woman\" trope to motivate the hero is old and tired, of course. The final voice-over should be corrected to indicate how it's only fatal to women to draw close to Ethan Hunt. His male buddies mostly make it out alive. Meanwhile, Grace is a very nice addition to the cast, with lovely acting and a cheeky, enjoyable character, together with Paris, the blond assassin, who makes you root for her all the way, from her mad laughter during the chase to her final redemption arc. Simon Pegg as Benj Dunn is always flawless, while Luther feels a bit underutilised. A few more things worth mentioning are how the supposed \"master of infiltration, deception, sabotage and psych warfare... a mind reading, shape-shifting incarnation of chaos\" almost never feels the need to even cover his face, despite all the agencies and enemies that are hot on his trail. The team's over-reliance on high-tech and online devices is baffling, while everyone keeps repeating how capillary the Entity's digital reach is. But the list of face-palms is long, in this script. With a weak, extremely uncharismatic opponent and a lot of scenic routes to nowhere, there's no plausible reason for this overlong movie to be split in two, either. All in all, while being the worse of the Mission Impossible franchise so far, it's still enjoyable in its own way."

      "review": "I am a big fan of the Mission: Impossible film franchise. They are consistently good quality films. With the exception of \"M: I 2\" (which can be fun in its own way) all of the films in series have been great. This one continues Tom Cruise's winning streak and keeps a solid track record for the IMF team. In this impossible mission, Hunt and his team must track down two halves of a single key, as it is the only way to stop a rogue A. I. known as \"the entity\". Along the way, many opposing groups try to stop Hunt and his team. For any given action set piece that transpires, there are a lot of moving parts to consider. More often than not, there are 3 or 4 different groups all trying to converge on the McGuffin or stop our heroes, all with various motives. The movie may cut back and forth to several action sequences going on simultaneously. Some characters might double cross another character. All of these complications make the adventure a whole lot of fun. It keeps the audience consistently on edge and guessing what could possibly go wrong next. The conflict in this movie is surprisingly relevant, with A. I. becoming more prevalent and even in danger of taking jobs away from movie writers and actors. In a way, this film becomes a meta narrative for Tom Cruise trying to save Hollywood from being replaced with A. I. generated stories. But enough about the story, how is the action? The movie has one of the best car chases I have ever seen. There is a great stunt and big train fight that is just relentlessly action packed. And there is a terrific bit in an airport with a lot of good spy espionage business. The newcomers of Hailey Atwell as Grace and Pom Klementieff as Paris are both terrific additions. Their characters add some good intrigue and sparks of adrenaline to the proceedings Cary Elwes is always a delight, and it is nice to see Henry Czerny return as Kittridge. Kirby, Ferguson, Pegg and Rhames all return and do a good job in their roles, but they are not given as much time to shine in this go around. Esai Morales plays the antagonist Gabriel, and he doesn't have much of presence in the film. I take it that there was some cut content from the beginning that would have given his character more of a connection with Ethan, but as is, he is a weak link in the movie. In summary, the latest Mission: Impossible movie delivers on some great action and characters. Some action scenes fail to impress, and the villain doesn't leave much of an impact. But overall, it is still a really good time. Choose to accept this mission."

Who comes up with these stunts? If you want to see a wall-to-wall action movie, you're not going to do any better than this. The acting is good in an \"action movie\" sense, but don't look for character development or anything like that, and you can't get much more serious than the plot line... the end of the world caused by an AI entity. Don't look for any \"meaning of life\" messages either. It's not that kind of movie. Just enjoy a hellofa ride... looking forward to part two."

Whilst some suspension of belief is always required to enjoy these spy capers in pursuit of joyous action driven craziness this outing takes matters way too far. The plot, if we can call it that, centres around a new adversary, the 'Entity\" which is some kind of AI super villain in the making. It's all a little too preposterous and not in a 'throw a chair with a bomb attached down a lift shaft at Nakatomi Plaza' kind of way. Action movies are often at their best when some brevity is introduced so that the seriousness is dialled down. The MI series has done that well at times but in this one both the story and the characters take second place to stunts (yes they're good though) and OTT portrayals played without a hint of irony. Maybe being filmed during covid didn't help in that regard because some past magic was certainly lost here. It's also rather long and boring. Not a good combo for an action flick."

At the end of the movie on the train, there was a scene where Grace was running away with the key, and two bad guys were running after her. One of them pointed a gun at her to have her put the key on the table. Grace spent like thirty seconds lowering the key to the table. The bad guy sent another bad guy to go get the key, and then the first bad guy told the other “Kill her.” That was pretty pointless since they pointed a gun at her the whole time."

      "review": "\"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One\" represents the latest foray into the high-octane, adrenaline-pumping world that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) inhabits, a realm where gravity is but a suggestion and the impossible is merely a challenge. Directed with the series' hallmark penchant for jaw-dropping action sequences and globe-trotting espionage, the film delivers on the promise of spectacle. However, beneath the glossy veneer of its well-choreographed chaos lies a narrative that feels as if it's running on autopilot, driven more by the need for speed than the compelling intricacies of plot or character depth. At the heart of this iteration's shortcomings is a plot that feels noticeably thin, as if the storyline were hastily sketched on a napkin during a high-speed chase. The decision to pit Ethan Hunt and his team against an AI antagonist could have opened a Pandora's box of contemporary fears and ethical dilemmas. Instead, it comes across as a somewhat lazy pivot to modernity, lacking the nuanced villainy that has marked the series' best entries. This AI, devoid of charisma or complexity, feels like a missed opportunity, reducing what could have been a memorable nemesis to little more than a plot device with an on/off switch. The characters, once the beating heart of the franchise, now seem to navigate the storyline with the emotional depth of the paper on which their lines were printed. The relationships and personal dilemmas that once added layers to the high-stakes missions have been sidelined, leaving viewers with a cast that operates with the efficiency of well-oiled machines rather than the flawed, passionate humans we once rooted for. This emotional vacuum makes it challenging to invest in the characters' fates, reducing the tension to a mere waiting game between action set pieces. Speaking of action, it is here that \"Dead Reckoning Part One\" undeniably shines. Each sequence is a testament to the film's dedication to pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved through stunts, practical effects, and sheer audacity. From breathtaking chases to vertiginous hand-to-hand combat, the action is filmed with a clarity and intensity that demands admiration. These moments are when the movie feels most alive, a thrilling ride that almost makes you forget the narrative shortcomings. However, this reliance on action underscores a fundamental imbalance. The film, in its pursuit of spectacle, neglects the storytelling craft, assuming that a good story would only get in the way of the next big stunt. While this might satisfy adrenaline junkies and action aficionados, it leaves those craving a cohesive, emotionally engaging narrative out in the cold. The unlogical storyline, with its leaps of logic and convenient resolutions, further alienates viewers who seek a plot that respects their intelligence. In conclusion, \"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One\" is a cinematic paradox: a marvel of action filmmaking that simultaneously feels like a step back for a franchise known for its ability to blend heart-stopping action with heart-felt storytelling. While it offers a masterclass in action cinema, it does so at the expense of a logical plot and emotional depth, rendering it a spectacle best enjoyed by those who prefer their movies fast, furious, and unencumbered by the weight of coherence or character development."

The denouement of the movie feels like a satisfying conclusion, while also being a good cliffhanger/set up for the sequel to come.

Gross Tom aside this move is riddled with terrible jokes, kitchy unrealistic scenes trying to pose as funny, and a Ving Rhames who can barely speak. The whole returning cast needs to retire because they're old, slow, and boring. No amount of special effects can make me believe this geriatric bunch can do much more than show up early to an early bird special.

From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema."

      "review": "Good, not great. Rather than the story driving the action or at least being the same quality level, here it seemed like they had great action sequences planned and weren't entirely sure how to string them together with the plot, which often felt rushed, uneven and a bit too convenient. Perhaps it was a COVID thing, but it left me underwhelmed. Not a fan of the icing of Rebecca Furgeson. She was also clearly sidelined for most of the movie before she was killed off. She wasn't there or if she was she had very few lines. It felt like they were looking to replace Rebecca Furgeson with a combination of Haliey Attwell and eventually Pom Klementieff. Both of the other two make almost no sense to join the team based on their character's histories--Attwell being a random thief and Klementieff being an agent/actor for the other side. IMF seems to now pick any pretty woman around who is somewhat interested and has no other life, which retcons and belittles the entire history of the Mission Impossible franchise, and turns it to a Robert Palmer video where the women can also fight. The \"choice\" is lazy writing and insulting to the audience; it cannot be reconciled with any other movie in the franchise that had more than the core team (mostly the earlier movies), in which the team members were trained operatives, not crooks that were given the \"choice.\" Overall, not nearly as interesting or compelling as it used to be."

E neste hall entra também \"Missão Impossivel (1996) fazendo quase 30 anos. Tendo em todos a participação de Tom Cruise. E temos Ving Rhames em todas ela também. Nestes quase 30 anos o filme também foi tendo suas mudanças. E digamos que nos primeiros filmes tivemos cenas icônicas como do helicóptero, invadindo a sala, turbilhão de água, escalando a montanha, a mascara,.... Hoje parece que teve um pouco do vírus de Velosez no exagero, porém com o pé mais no chão. Aqui o filme começa com um submarino tendo senhas de lançamento de misseis atômicos que afundou e as chaves de liberação sumiram. E todos estão atrás delas. E a equipe de Hunt tem a missão de encontrar as chaves. Além do elenco já conhecido aqui temos Grce como uma ladra e se torna uma pedra no caminho de Hunt e temos a assassina Paris e o vilão Gabriel. Gabriel é um rival de Hunt que se achava que estava morto, e tem muitas habilidades como de Hunt. O filme tem várias reviravoltas, principalmente por causa de Grace. Antigas cenas como da mascara tem aqui também. Com várias locações o filme se passa em vários locais, com muita ação, e acrobacias, e claro sempre com a contagem regressiva em vários momentos. Muitas cenas estão focados em Grace e em Paris. E neste filme teremos a perca de alguém da equipe, quem será? Ou será que Hunt conseguirá salvar. Uma das cenas icônicas do filme esta no salto do penhasco com a mota e lembrando que são cenas feitas pelo próprio Tom. Bastante efeitos especiais, CGI bem executados, tanto que é o filme com maior oorçamento da franquia. Este foi a 1ª parte, pela qualidade do filme achei que as bilheterias foram baixas. Roteiro e enredo como sempre temos que prestar a atenção para não nos perdermos o roteiro. Vale apena assistir? Sim Nota: 8,5"

As usual the series of Mission Impossible travel with the same template, like chasing in the car/bike/train/dessert fight etc., but all the scenes are taken in classic manner. This time the story is little different, the main hero of this film is consequence due to Artificial Intelligence. Already many cinemas came based on problem of modern technology, particularly \"i robot\" is the very famous and notable. But this, travel similar to Bond film . We can see the wrinkles with Tom Cruise, but his physical fitness is amazing and unbelievable. All other characters are acted well, could avoid nude scenes [ in the bar] usually Indian audience willing to watch action films with family, we had embracing situation. There is a notable technical flaw in the film. The train runs with coal energy, villain murdered the engine drivers, my doubt is if feeding of coal is stopped how the train is running through out the film that too with super speed… [ in film only it is possible ..ha ha ] Good luck team Awaiting for the continuation"

If the entity was so against being shut down, why didn't it just have Gabriel destroy the key, or blow up the building when everyone is in the same place.

      "review": "Mission Impossible 7 is the first part to the Dead Reckoning chapter of this spy thrilling franchise which brings action, drama, comedy, and a whole cast of characters from the franchise that make these movies so enjoyable and entertaining. This movie stars returning actors like Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames while also adding some new talent like Pom Klementieff, Esai Morales, Shea Whigham but the person who really stoodout to me and helped carry this movie with Cruise is Hayley Atwell as Grace. Her and Cruise just had this organic chemistry that felt so natural with how they carried themselves, the banter, it really gave me the vibes of Steve and Natasha from The Winter Soldier but with a less serious approach. The action in this movie was outstanding as well as the stunts and fight choreography. These movies just continue getting bigger and better with stunt design, creativity, and making these scenes look so incredible and visually engaging. Now the story in this movie I thought was very well done as it both deals with real life topics while also introducing us to someone from Ethan's past in the antagonist which is Gabriel who is played by Esai Morales, which his presence felt threatening on screen, he really gave that feeling that you'd get from a Darth Vader, or a Thanos just by his presence. Now the topic this story really revolves around is AI and how powerful and dangerous it can be with the capabilities it can have and how AI can have access to so many things and resources if it gets out of control which this movie represents and the way they show it in this movie is not just frightening but also feels so real and gets enhanced just from the great writing from how it's portrayed and delivered through the film. I also didn't think this movie was too long at all as it's more than 2 and a half hours long but with the amount of action and how engaged and invested this movie gets you, the time will fly by. Overall, Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One is probably the biggest, and best installment in the franchise so far as it brings the notches up with what makes this franchise so awesome. Mission Impossible 7 gets an A+"

I'm also left wondering why, with a bloated budget of $291 million, this sequel feels less spectacular than the others in the franchise. There are a few fun action sequences along with some suspenseful moments, and I thought Hayley Atwell fit in well with the rest of the cast, but I miss the days when Mission: Impossible was about a singular assignment told in one movie."

Becky Ferguson probably wanted out so they let her die in a lame and weird way; a new female needs to be introduced, so a thief could fight like a secret agent; plus where are the creativity and humor?

With Ethan Hunt leading the charge, the IMF team races against time to prevent a catastrophic weapon from falling into the wrong hands. What sets this installment apart is its captivating plot that feels both refreshingly renewed and intricately crafted, proving that even in its seventh outing, the series still packs a punch. Christopher McQuarrie's direction, coupled with Lorne Balfe's brilliant musical composition, sets the stage for an immersive experience. The introduction of 'The Entity,' a self-learning AI, as the main plotline adds a layer of realism and urgency that grips the audience from start to finish. While Tom Cruise continues to astound with his dedication, the film does stumble a bit with an excessive runtime and uneven pacing. Yet, despite these minor hiccups, it stands as the franchise's best entry yet, dazzling with its realism, stunning visuals, and Hayley Atwell's standout performance, adding a new layer of badassery to the team. The only downside? It's part one, leaving audiences craving resolution. Nevertheless, \"Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1\" is a thrilling ride that redefines the spy genre, proving that even in its seventh iteration, this franchise knows how to keep us on the edge of our seats."

      "review": "Dead Reckoning represents a tonal shift in the franchise. There are too many characters, and too many attempts to have emotional or visual flair with all of them at once. There is a lot more exposition where characters seem to be more praising or pumping up the reputations of villains and threats, rather than keeping objective and letting the plot speak. Mission: Impossible transformed years ago into a part buddy comedy and part gadget-spy action franchise, but Dead Reckoning seems like a soft reboot. The audience is given little credit, and the plot is full of leaps the audience must just accept. My suspension of disbelief became exhausted. Rather than clever or fun, Dead Reckoning seemed to borrow tropes from anime and fantasy genres and became derivative. Everyone has a nickname, every villain has some history with the protagonist, and every threat is played up like it is insurmountable and ultimate. Pom Klementieff's character \"Paris\" comes off as a wannabe Harley Quinn, and is full of visual flair, but not any particular menace. That goes for a lot of threats in this film. They all seem so impotent, probably designed as foil to the big baddie. The government team chasing Ethan Hunt might as well have Yackety Sax overlaid on all their scenes - they are more comic relief, and yet another unnecessary source of chaos. This is a particularly weak entry in the franchise because it seems like it was written for a different audience - one with a short attention span, and one that hasn't seen any previous entries. Mission: Impossible has more recently been about an expanding cast of characters, and some witty charm. Dead Reckoning plays out like it needed someone to reign in the scope creep of too many ideas. It's overblown, even for this franchise."

But it's been awhile since they've REALLY leaned into the emotional side of things, i.e. that one scene from MI3 with the helicopter and the girl... But they definitely took us back there on a beautiful little bridge in Venice. Not to mention a train chapter that kept you on the edge from start to finish with intensity. A villain worth watching (thank you, Senor Deathstroke, wink wink) and a cliffhanger for the ages. I've seen some people say it'll be hard to top this with the finale but I don't think it will. This entire film set up as an origin story to the real heartbreak that's surely to come with Part Two. Will it be a fan favorite? A long time friend? Or will Ethan Hunt get his \"No Time To Die\" moment? Either way, I can't wait to see in the passenger seat and let Tom Cruise take us to the finish line in what has been an incredible franchise.

The plot has many holes, characters know information they shouldn't, exposition is continuously dumped on the audience by all sources to try and explain what is going on; in fact there is an excessive amount of spoon feeding and hand holding done to the audience it starts to feel insulting and just plain boring.

The US intelligence meeting in the first ten minutes has a laughingly doomsday tone with a startlingly lack of any reference to actual information. Unfortunately, the inadequately justified tone (the villain just wants death for everyone for no reason!) dominates throughout the film. Worst of all, it’s disappointingly humorless. Even the impressively strong core of actors from the prior films are given little to work with here. It’s predictable and even somewhat boring. If you want to have fun watching, MSK3000 this failure. Seriously, please get MI back on track. It used to be a fun, quality spy/action series.

Nothing at all – they are just that forgettable to me. Especially I do not remember who lives and who died, the villains and their plans and the status of the world at large, so each and every time I feel like watching a nearly completely new franchise. This way I have no fatigue with \"Mission: Impossible\" they way I have it with e.g. James Bond, and perhaps this is why I enjoyed the seventh (!) installment in this series as much as I did. It is just a great action movie, pure and simple. Sure, Tom Cruise is not as young and agile as he used to be and this affects the kind of stunts that he can pull off, but this is not a problem here at all, the action is still great, though a lot of it now takes place in a car, or on a motorbike etc. Hayley Atwell is a great addition to the team, certainly better than Phoebe Waller-Bridge to Indiana Jones. And so I am looking forward for the eight part, although I am afraid that when it does come out I will have already long forgotten what the seventh part was all about..."

      "review": "A lot of great action scenes, and a lot of goofy nonsense. Tom Cruise can ride a motorcycle. Dialogue and story are weak. Expository statements are wedged in everywhere against attempts at cheeky humor which fail more than half the time. Super serious sounding verbiage about the fate of mankind, etc., is rampant. We have seen ALL of this before, seven times. But, we have winter holidays like Hanukkah and Christmas every year, and make the best of it. Even though it may not change much, we enjoy it to the extent it is possible. This would analogously be a bad year, as other MI entries have been better than this one. It kind of trudges along, and is nearly overstaying its welcome. Also, I really believe, given access to the 250 million+ dollars it cost to make this there is no excuse for it not being better. Maybe spend a bit more of the budget on writing and story development, and cut out a few seconds from the 90 minutes spent on martial arts fight scenes high speed chasing?"
