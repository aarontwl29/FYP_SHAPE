When will these companies understand that we want real reviews....\"here's looking at you Yelp\"! Watch the trailer, then reduce your expectations by 150%....then watch it! You know, because \"it got such a high rating\"! Even if you do that, you will still be disappointed, that of course in less you are a BOT or Paid Reviewer. Yes, I can tell the difference between a good movie I don't like that is good and from one that is bad. This is bad. Consider yourself warned."

      "review": "(CASTELLANO) Una comedia de acci√≥n alocada, macarra y sorprendentemente tierna, 'Novocaine' es de esas pel√≠culas que no buscan cambiar el cine, pero lo pasan tan bien con lo que hacen que terminan gan√°ndose al espectador. La idea central tiene gancho: un tipo que no siente dolor se ve envuelto en una cadena absurda de violencia cartoon, con un romance inesperado de por medio. Podr√≠a haber sido una tonter√≠a sin alma, pero entre el ritmo, el humor y un reparto con qu√≠mica, funciona. Jack Quaid est√° realmente bien. Cada vez m√°s natural, m√°s c√≥modo, m√°s graciosamente torpe, se ha ganado a pulso un hueco en este tipo de cine. Y la chica (Amber Midthunder, inolvidable en 'Prey') le aguanta el tipo sin problemas, aportando fuerza, carisma y una presencia que llena la pantalla. Juntos hacen cre√≠ble una historia que, de entrada, no deber√≠a funcionar. No todo est√° tan afinado. El segundo acto flojea un poco, y hay momentos donde la pel√≠cula se repite o se vuelve m√°s convencional. Pero tiene suficientes buenas ideas, escenas divertidas y personajes entra√±ables como para compensarlo. Y ese toque de violencia exagerada que, lejos de molestar, ayuda a mantener el tono desenfadado. Sin ser perfecta, 'Novocaine' es una de esas gratas sorpresas que mezclan acci√≥n y comedia sin caer en lo t√≥pico. No inventa nada, pero tiene claro lo que quiere ser. Y eso, a veces, es justo lo que uno necesita. (ENGLISH) A wild, rowdy, and surprisingly tender action comedy, Novocaine is one of those films that doesn‚Äôt aim to change cinema, but has so much fun doing its thing that it ends up winning the viewer over. The central idea is catchy: a guy who doesn‚Äôt feel pain gets caught up in an absurd chain of cartoon violence, with an unexpected romance along the way. It could have been a soulless gimmick, but thanks to its pace, humor, and a cast with great chemistry, it works. Jack Quaid is genuinely great. He‚Äôs becoming more natural, more at ease, more charmingly clumsy‚Äîhe‚Äôs truly earned his place in this kind of film. And the girl (Amber Midthunder, unforgettable in Prey) holds her own without a hitch, bringing strength, charisma, and a presence that lights up the screen. Together, they make believable a story that, at first glance, shouldn‚Äôt really work. Not everything is so finely tuned. The second act sags a bit, and there are moments when the film gets repetitive or slips into more conventional beats. But it has enough good ideas, fun scenes, and endearing characters to make up for it. And that exaggerated violence? Far from annoying‚Äîit actually helps keep things light and playful. It‚Äôs not perfect, but Novocaine is one of those pleasant surprises that mix action and comedy without falling into clich√©. It doesn‚Äôt reinvent anything, but it knows exactly what it wants to be. And sometimes, that‚Äôs just what you need."

This movie has it's painful side too but it's painless side takes the lead. The movie began by unfolding some plot twists(which was very well done if you ask me). Jack Quaid took the lead and lead the casts on a painless ride to near-perfection. The whole story was silly, but surprisingly it works so well because of the direction it took.

The dialogues are mostly funny, but sometimes a little corny, especially in the third act. On the other hand the big plot twist surprised me. I laughingly said that Sherry would be a government agent and it was funny and surprising to see that she's actually with the robbers. The cinematography is mixed, because the action scenes look amazing, but some of the quiet scenes look televisionish. The action sequences are very original and probably the best part of the movie.

      "review": "‚ÄúAlmost perfect‚Äù is the best way to describe Novocaine in two words. The film gets so much right ‚Äî from well-executed setups and payoffs to the small, immersive details that make the story feel real. But one major choice holds it back from being a true 10/10. Summary Novocaine follows the story of Nate, a common banker who suffers from ‚ÄòCongenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis.‚Äô CIPA makes him immune to feeling pain and temperature, and Nate uses this ability to get his girlfriend back from bank robbers who have taken her hostage. Attention to detail Right from the start, the movie shows strong attention to detail ‚Äî like the tennis balls on every corner in Nate‚Äôs home and office, and the fact that he drinks liquids with ice to avoid burning himself. These small but impactful choices make the film feel thoughtful and well put together. This attention to detail is also shown in how the movie takes the time to explain Nate‚Äôs motivation for trying to rescue his love interest (Sherry). Before she was kidnapped, Sherry and Nate had only been on one date. In most movies, the main character risking his life for a love interest he barely knows is just accepted as movie logic, but instead, Novocaine makes the effort to try to explain why Nate would do so. Novocaine does this through both its overall narrative choices and more subtle clues. The narrative choice that Novocaine makes is to give Sherry her own trauma. This gives her and Nate a common element to bond over quickly as they both hesitantly become more and more vulnerable with one another. Novocaine then further gives us a glimpse into Nate‚Äôs mind and justification through the use of ‚ÄòEarl.‚Äô Earl is a character we meet early in the movie as we see Nate help Earl out with his financial problems after the death of his wife. When Nate and Earl talk about his recently deceased wife and how much he misses her, he says the line, ‚ÄòIt would hurt the same if I had met her the day before.‚Äô This one line is successfully used to justify the entire movie‚Äôs premise. It does not matter that Nate had met Sherry the day before; he cares about her just the same as he would have if they had met a year before. CIPA The movie also does a good job of avoiding its most obvious downfall: just because Nate cannot feel pain doesn‚Äôt mean he is invulnerable. A common mistake that many movies like this tend to make is to treat the character‚Äôs invulnerability to feeling pain as an invulnerability to getting hurt. Novocaine, for the most part, avoids this mistake. A majority of the wounds that Nate sustains are those that would hurt like hell for normal people but would not physically hinder them. The movie does stretch this limit as it progresses, but it does a good enough job of being realistic at the start, so by the end, the audience is willing to accept the lack of realism for the sake of the story the movie delivers. Though in Novocaine‚Äôs defence, when Nate starts receiving wounds which should physically hinder him from saving Sherry, he also uses EpiPens (pure adrenaline) to push himself to continue. So, at least, Novocaine does not completely ignore the physical effects that Nate‚Äôs wounds should have on him. The Character Arc An important element to every good movie is the ‚Äòcharacter arc‚Äô of its main character. If the audience does not see the main character change by what happens to them, then the movie usually ends up feeling quite one-dimensional and lacking impact. Again, Novocaine does a good job of avoiding this pitfall. We, the audience, slowly see Nate go from this spineless man who is scared of everything that has the smallest chance of hurting him to a murderer- a justified one, perhaps, but still a murderer. Novocaine also does not make the mistake of showing this change as something instant. Nate does not become a full-fledged assassin after his first kill. On the contrary, his first kill leaves him disturbed and shaken by what he has done. Only by his third kill does the audience see him become comfortable with both what he has done and what he still needs to do to rescue Sherry. This gradual arc instead of a sudden change helps his character feel more real and not just a vessel for us to see Novocaine‚Äôs new idea (having a hero with CIPA). The Problem Now, to address the elephant in the room, the problem that stopped Novocaine from being a 10/10, Sherry is a double agent for the bank robbers. This was such a nonsensical decision in an otherwise perfect movie. It feels like one of those choices that a producer makes, a decision to add a twist to a movie where one was not needed. Novocaine could have been the perfect love story; Nate risking his life to save Sherry after one date is a bit nonsensical, but Novocaine recognised that and took the necessary steps to make sure that the audience is not left confused by this. Novocaine was doing everything right, and then someone- the director, producer, actor, whoever- wanted some kind of plot twist, so they tried to shove it into a movie where it simply didn‚Äôt belong. The added problem to this decision is that, Sherry being a double agent is revealed early in the movie. This then has the unfortunate effect of degrading the rest of the movie as the audience is left wondering why they made Sherry a double agent and are less focused on the other thing that Novocaine does right. Conclusion In conclusion, Novocaine is worth watching at least once. In a landscape full of movies that seem to copy each other and try to recapture the magic of movies past, Novocaine avoids almost every single cliche and common pitfall to deliver a fun and, most importantly, unique experience. But the one mistake it makes ruins its entire narrative and leaves a sour taste in the audience's mouth. Personally, I absolutely loved the movie. It was something new and exciting, but I will never go out of my way to watch it again. The plot twist adds nothing to the movie but is certainly irritating."

The jokes are mostly hit and you will actually laugh while watching it. I think the best thing that the movie does is that it connects you to the main character and at some point you start feeling emotions towards that character. When the main character is in a fight you actually hope they win without major injuries. The main hero could literally be any of us, the story is about an average man, and when the hero is so similar to the average person you start feeling like you are there. Easily my biggest surprise this year, did not even plan on watching it. Randomly chose a movie and really enjoyed it. It could be the definition of a fun movie."

I honestly hope Jack Quaid becomes a new face of movies coz I loved his AI movie called companion that came also this year and novocaine was a top notch movie."

      "review": "Novocaine is what happens when you mix John Wick, Home Alone, and a middle schooler‚Äôs wild daydream. Jack Quaid plays Nathan Caine, a painfully average guy who literally can‚Äôt feel pain thanks to a rare condition. When his crush gets kidnapped by violent, bank-robbing Santas, he turns into a one-man wrecking crew‚Äîbloody, bruised, but never broken. The film leans hard into its absurd premise, serving up gnarly action and twisted humor without tipping into full-on slapstick. Quaid is hilarious and strangely endearing, even when he's stabbing dudes with his own broken bones. It‚Äôs over-the-top, messy, and loses steam by the end, but if you like your action dumb, violent, and oddly heartfelt‚Äîyou‚Äôll have a good time. Just don‚Äôt think too hard. Verdict: Dumb fun, lots of blood, Jack Quaid chaos."

For me personally, while the story wasn't the most mind-blowing thing of all time, I still found it to be a very well-done film and a very well-made story. I also believe the action scenes were great, blending comedy and action perfectly. The whole premise is an incredible idea for a film, and I think they executed it perfectly. I went into this with fairly high expectations - and I ended up liking it even more than I thought I would. It's funny, but sometimes a little emotional too, which is perfect. Jack Quaid's performance as the protagonist is amazing, a perfect casting choice alongside great acting. I truly cannot think of anything I dislike about this film, I think it's an amazing movie and more people need to see it. Underrated, while still rated high. Perfect for me."

It's got great action and heart. The acting is pretty good considering half of Dennis Quaid's DNA is mixed in with half of Meg Ryan's to make the star of the show. But you really have to suspend reality when you consider things like the probation sentence and less than 2 years for the heroine of the show, who is an accessory after the fact for several murders... of Police Officers. Of course, it's California, so maybe. LOL. But hey, if you want to have a semi-light and grisly thrill ride with your date, this is your film!"

While the \"good guy turning bad\" or \"villain vs. redeemed villain\" plot feels a bit clich√©, the movie executes it well, maintaining tension and entertainment throughout. It may not be the most original storyline, but strong character development and a well-crafted atmosphere make it work. Jacob Batalon also delivers a solid performance, and it was great to see him step outside his usual Spider-Man role. His presence adds energy to the film and fits well within the story. Overall, Novocaine (2025) is a highly entertaining film with great performances and a plot that, while somewhat predictable, keeps you hooked thanks to its execution and pacing."

Den Machern ist bewusst, dass der \"Star\" des Filmes, der Gimmik: Schmerzfrei ist, und dieser wird voll ausgenutzt.

The acting was well done but nothing to ride home about. And the plot? Well it was fine. It really reminded me of Die Hard. Just a very straightforward plot. The relationships between characters was also a mixed bag. Some were done perfectly but a few left something to be desired. My main critique was with the plot twist. It was done so early that it left the rest of the movie craving a gasp worthy moment. But overall, it's a good movie if all you're looking for is a creative flick to kind of turn your brain off and enjoy."

The exact opposite of a pain to watch, Novocaine gets an adrenaline shot of charm while finding increasingly demented ways to utilize its concept. Vulnerable, thoughtful, sarcastic and empathetic, the film will have you laughing and wincing simultaneously, and the lower your pain tolerance is, the more it will make you do both of those things. It gets more mileage from its central gimmick thanks to a clever and amusing screenplay that adeptly sprinkles laughs amid its cartoonish action set pieces. It helps that Quaid is so good at landing every punchline, if not punch. The level of gleeful mayhem this action-packed outing manages to achieve is impressive, it sets its sights low and wildly exceeds them for most of its brisk and bloody running time. Cheerfully violent, stunt-stuffed and well-acted, it's hard not to appreciate Novocaine's simplicity and bone-crunching gore, which allow for some truly creative chaos."

      "review": "The main character (Nate) played by Jack Quaid is a man with a simple and average life - work, playing on the computer and sleeping. What sets him apart from the rest is a rare genetic disease that prevents him from feeling pain. His everyday life changes when he meets a girl with whom he quickly befriends and who also works with him in a bank. Everything takes a dramatic turn when she is taken hostage during a robbery of their workplace. The hero forced to act must overcome his weaknesses and use his unusual ailment to find it. Although the very concept of a man insensitive to pain who uses it in combat may sound intriguing, unfortunately the film cannot make good use of this potential. The plot is predictable, so almost every scene can be predicted, but maybe except for one and quite a slight twist. Despite everything, the whole thing gives the impression of something that we have seen many times, and the script does not even try to add freshness to it. The film is also a dark comedy, but the only moments that made me smile are due to the charisma of Jack Quaid. His performance is just good, no madness, but throughout the movie I couldn't resist the impression that I was watching Hughie from The Boys. To sum up - an interesting concept was wasted by a boring, predictable plot and not very funny, cheap jokes. It's a movie that could rather fit in the background at dinner or cleaning. For me ‚Äì unfortunately a disappointment."

Often when I was laughing I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was due to Joy or Defence cuz the film goes pretty damn dark while effectively keeping a positive and light-hearted demeanour. Jack Quaid plays the roll exactly as you‚Äôd expect but sadly he‚Äôs the only talent on screen you want to watch, with the rest of the cast sorta just ‚Ä¶ there. I could not tell you a single other characters name. Doesn‚Äôt really matter though, as the point of the film is to see poor Nate constantly find himself in unlikely but funny environments for him to get hurt. Though to get to ANY of that - there‚Äôs like an entire half of the movie which is more or less setup. I commend the filmmakers for trying to make us care about the lead and his wild Hero attempt - it simply takes too long. In the final act though, I had to knock off an entire point because of a moment that is so incredibly stupid and essentially a plot-hole. Not just that, but I rolled my eyes because it was a VERY lazy trope to give the film an extra 15 minutes or so for a second climax. There‚Äôs also a pretty interesting reveal but it happens about half-way into the movie and would have been far more effective if the story held onto what is genuinely a good idea a bit longer for it to match the leads journey. As an audience we are privy to this piece of information that really, really wasn‚Äôt necessary. Still - it‚Äôs a fun time and if you‚Äôre a fan of some creative, gore-y, and bloody brutality, there‚Äôs plenty to appreciate. #novocaine #moviereview"

      "review": "A Jolt of Fun, But Does It Signal a Dull Year Ahead? Jack Quaid's turn as an unlikely action hero in 2025's Novocaine offers a refreshing, if slightly numbing, twist on the current action movie landscape. Quaid, known for his more comedic and everyman roles, embraces the physical demands of the genre with surprising agility and a healthy dose of self-aware charm. The film itself feels like a shot of adrenaline, delivering fast-paced action sequences and a plot that, while occasionally predictable, keeps the audience engaged. Novocaine plays with the \"ordinary person thrust into extraordinary circumstances\" trope, but injects it with a welcome dose of humor. Quaid's character, a mild-mannered dentist caught in a web of international espionage, is a far cry from the muscle-bound action stars we're accustomed to. His reactions are often hilarious, and his fish-out-of-water persona provides a constant source of amusement. However, while Novocaine is undeniably entertaining, it also falls into the trap of early-year releases that often feel like a \"just okay\" experience. It's a fun ride, but lacks the lasting impact of truly great action films. And, with having been going weekly to the theater for several years now, I can't help but notice the trend: when the early months of the year offer up a slate of merely passable films, it often foreshadows a less-than-stellar cinematic year overall (with the exception of horror, it seems). Novocaine is a solid popcorn flick, perfect for a casual night out. Quaid proves he can handle the action genre, and the film delivers on its promise of entertainment. But, it doesn't break any new ground, and it leaves me with a lingering sense of \"been there, done that.\" While I hope this isn't a harbinger of things to come, Novocaine serves as a reminder that we may be in for a year of more \"good enough\" than truly exceptional cinema."

With Jack Quaid leading the charge (always a win), it‚Äôs a chaotic blend of painful-looking stunts, laugh-out-loud moments, and a surprisingly sweet love story underneath all the mayhem. The chemistry between the leads? Off the charts‚Äîyou *get* why he‚Äôs willing to throw himself into absolute carnage to win her back. And speaking of carnage, the injuries here look **painfully** real. I flinched. More than once. Sure, the story plays it safe‚Äîpredictable beats and all‚Äîbut when the action‚Äôs this fun and the gags land this hard, who‚Äôs complaining? The creative ways people get hurt are both hilarious and horrifying (in the best way), and the slick special effects make it all pop. Honestly, I can already picture a franchise. If you want brutal laughs with a side of heart, this one‚Äôs for you."

Doch Bankr√§uber nehmen Shelly als Geisel und um das einzige nicht zu verlieren was seinem Leben einen Sinn ergibt ist Nathan bereit alles zu riskieren. Denn auch wenn er keine Schmerzen sp√ºrt, er kann jede Minute an allem m√∂glichen sterben ohne es zu merken. Mr. No Pain geht ca. 110 Minuten und ist ab 18 Jahren freigegeben. Wir haben hier eine Action-Kom√∂die mit Jack Quaid (The Boys) in der Hauptrolle des sympathisch verpeilten Kerlchens. Etwas was man von ihm kennt, dennoch f√ºhlt sich die Figur des Nathan nach mehr an. Dies liegt an seiner eigentlichen Tragik das quasi alles ihn t√∂ten k√∂nnte und er es nicht mal mit bekommen w√ºrde. Das nun auch noch die Frau entf√ºhrt wird die in ihn mehr sieht als nur etwas wor√ºber man sich lustig macht, l√§sst ihn zum Helden wider Willen werden. Jack Quaid spielt gewohnt solide und die Handlung dreht sich haupts√§chlich darum Shelly zu finden sowie Nathan in verr√ºckte Situationen zu werfen, die aufgrund seiner Besonderheit sehr komisch dargestellt werden. So ist ein Kampf in einer K√ºche mit hei√üen Ger√§ten, eine Folter unter der man vor schreien einen zweiten Stimmbruch bekommen w√ºrde oder das t√∂ten mit mehr als seinen blo√üen H√§nden herrlich am√ºsant inszeniert. Die B√∂sewichte sind f√ºr das was sie sein sollen klasse, gerade Ray Nicholson (Smile 2). Der Humor ist hervorragend, die tragische Figur Nathan ist klasse geschrieben und bietet Potenzial noch soviel mehr zu erz√§hlen. Am Ende bleibt ein Werk das von vorne bis hinten Spa√ü macht. Die Kills sind einfallsreich, der Humoraspekt des Nicht wehtuns super und die Figuren bieten alle genug um einen nicht egal zu sein. Leider gibt es ein paar unlogische Dinge √ºber die man aber lachend den Kopfsch√ºtteln kann. Von mir bekommt der Film 8/10 Punkten. Keine Schmerzen empfinden, ein Traum bei f√ºr jeden Zahnarzt Besuch oder jeder Prostatauntersuchung."

      "review": "(SPOILER ALERT) Novocaine is exactly the kind of movie you sit down with on a casual evening ‚Äî chips in one hand, glass of wine in the other ‚Äî and just enjoy. It doesn‚Äôt try to be groundbreaking, nor does it need to be. It‚Äôs a simple and entertaining action-comedy with a fun premise and a likable protagonist. Nathan Cain (Jack Quaid) suffers from a rare condition that prevents him from feeling physical pain. Rather than using it as some kind of superpower, he lives a cautious, low-profile life. That is, until his coworker ‚Äî who he just so happens to be falling for ‚Äî gets kidnapped, and Nathan decides to go full vigilante. The story is straightforward and uncomplicated, but thanks to a few clever ideas and some solid humor, it works. Jack Quaid plays Nathan with endearing awkwardness, gradually transforming into a kind of homegrown action hero ‚Äî no training, just sheer determination. The action scenes are well-executed, the visuals are decent, and the comedy mostly stems from Nathan‚Äôs inability to feel pain, which is used to great effect (especially in the torture scene, which is both absurd and hilarious). The film does lose a bit of steam in the second half, dipping into some predictable genre tropes, but it never completely derails. It maintains a fresh tone, even if it leans into clich√©s by the end. Its biggest drawback is that it‚Äôs not really a ‚Äúcinema experience‚Äù ‚Äî most people will probably enjoy it more at home than on a big screen. All in all, Novocaine is a light-hearted action comedy with a fun concept that may not be fully explored, but still delivers as an enjoyable watch. |7/10|"

The overt gore (borderline torture porn except for the hero being unable to experience physical torture) and the sloppy writing make the majority of the movie almost unwatchable. The acting is believable and the motivations are fine - but getting anything to connect in Novacaine takes a wild leap of reason that I a cannot muster. Ok, so we have a guy who has lived his entire life with the concern that he will be dead tomorrow if he strays from his rigid routine of liquid food (so he doesn't bite off his tongue), careful driving (I don't know why), and putting tennis balls on every corner of his office at the bank (because apparently he can't identify if his body is jolted from hitting something sturdy like a desk). Oh, also he has to leave conversations awkwardly instead of snoozing his alarm for 1 minute to pee so his bladder doesn't burst. But he also tattoos himself with abandon and CAN be an action hero without biting off his tongue or having a blood loss that actually kills him accidentally I ask a lot from movies - I get it. I want one that adheres to it's premise. If you're going to write something and send it to theaters, have the writing make sense in the world you've created."

The good ones have actors who shine in their roles and there are no wasted characters. The female lead, villains, supporting cop characters and the comic relief character (Jacob Batalon, take a bow!)--all exceeded my expectations. This does not happen by accident. It take script changes, good directing and committed acting. One critic called the violence Looney Tune-esque, another to the Three Stooges. No. The correct comparison is the Saw horror movies.

My friend and I left after we saw what happened with the tattoo artist. I would be ashamed if I was Quaid to even be in this movie. We got our money back and left to shop and have a nice afternoon."

The redeeming quality is that it doesn't go exactly where you think it will. I'm not giving anything away by saying the level to which this guys body gets mangled is beyond belief. Basic human anatomy is ignored in this story. He would have bled out multiple times. He could have been hurt in milder ways that would help the story be told in a more realistic manner. The law doesn't seem to actually be the law in this alternative universe. Apparently if you have a good heart it redeems you of all other wrongs."

San Diego was only shown in stock flyover scenes. Other than that, not a single scene was actually filmed in San Diego. Lots of opportunities to suspend your disbelief. Also lots of corny one-liners. \"Go Padres\" at Christmastime???"
