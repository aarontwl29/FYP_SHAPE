      "review": "After watching all five installments of the horror comedy franchise FINAL DESTINATION in the past week, I‚Äôm paranoid AF. I now understand why my generation has feared planes, trains, automobiles, tanning beds, logging trucks, rollercoasters, car races, bridges, and many more things since 2000. FINAL DESTINATION: BLOODLINES, the first installment in 14 years and the sixth one overall, has come out. College student Stefani (Kaitlyn Santa Juana) is failing because of a recurring nightmare of a disaster that sets this movie up to perfection. Looking for answers, she goes back home to her family and finds out that her nightmare actually happened to her estranged grandmother, who had a premonition of the dreamt disaster and saved a lot of lives that should‚Äôve ended that day. Well, when you f*** with Death, things get messy. This franchise has been very formulaic in its‚Ä¶execution, so I appreciate how this one builds on the lore of Death and how it operates. Death is now crossing generations and bloodlines. Filmed here in Vancouver, the production team has fun building sets like a deadly game of Mouse Trap, having a chaotic but controlled domino effect that the franchise is known for. This movie doesn‚Äôt hold back on the creative and violent deaths. They are so entertaining and are so much fun to try to decipher. The legendary actor Tony Todd is back in this one, this sadly being his final on-screen performance after passing away last year. Being in a few of these movies before, the filmmakers here decided to give his character more of an impact and actual depth. From his dialogue in this movie, it felt like he knew that Death was coming for him soon, which made this scene surprisingly emotional. This movie actually deals with the theme of generational trauma, which is surprisingly and refreshingly deep for this franchise. It‚Äôs so rare when a sequel is the best one of a franchise, I can only think of this and SAW. The movie has clever song choices that make you smile. It has phenomenal gore effects blending both CGI and practical. Despite the easter eggs long-time fans will recognize, you don‚Äôt need to see the previous installments to get the full picture this movie is painting in blood. This is my favourite, successfully delivering what it needed to to rejuvenate the franchise. Critics have never really given this franchise a fair shake, but I‚Äôm so happy that has now changed. FINAL DESTINATION: BLOODLINES is brutal in the best ways, and I highly recommend it if you‚Äôre a fan of comedic horror. As for the franchise itself, I think it has successfully avoided Death yet again."

      "review": "\"Final Destination: Bloodlines\" delivers exactly what fans of the series have come to expect: a creatively gruesome and engaging ride centered around the terrifying inevitability of death. This installment offers a fresh set of unfortunate souls trying to outrun their predetermined demise, and for the most part, it succeeds in keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. The film stays true to the core concept of the \"Final Destination\" movies, introducing a new, shocking premonition that saves a group from a catastrophic event, only for Death itself to begin systematically picking them off in increasingly elaborate and horrifying ways. The creativity in the death sequences remains a key draw, and \"Bloodlines\" doesn't disappoint in this regard, offering some truly inventive and wince-inducing demises. The characters, while perhaps not deeply developed, serve their purpose as the next in line for Death's intricate designs. The tension builds effectively as the survivors desperately try to understand the rules of Death's game and find a way to break free from its grasp. The film maintains a good pace, offering enough suspense and shocking moments to keep the audience engaged. While \"Final Destination: Bloodlines\" provides a solid and entertaining experience for fans of the franchise, its 7/10 rating suggests that it might not break significant new ground or reach the heights of some of the earlier installments. Perhaps the formula, while still effective, feels somewhat familiar, or certain aspects of the plot or character development could have been stronger. Overall, if you're a fan of the \"Final Destination\" series and enjoy its signature blend of suspense, gore, and the macabre dance with fate, \"Bloodlines\" is a really good and engaging watch that delivers the expected thrills."

One thing I love about this movie is that it's a fresh spin from the start. How a repeated nightmare leads to finding answers. Which also leads to everyone believing a crazy theory, that in the beginning nobody wanted to understand and always brushed it off. But now things are getting real and more crazy, let's just say, AMAZING!!! Now why did I put only 4 stars.... well the ending was cut off to quick. Now I'm thirsty for more."

      "review": "‚ÄúFinal Destination: Bloodlines‚Äù may share DNA with its five older siblings, but it‚Äôs the shared DNA of the characters in the sixth installment that shakes up the dynamic completely. Compared to the earlier entries (those glossy, Dawson‚Äôs Creek-adjacent morality plays where pretty teens get pancaked by fate and the only suspense is how they‚Äôll die rather than why we should care) Bloodlines dares to shift the formula. And surprisingly, it works. Gone (or at least pared back) is the parade of annoying archetypes and one-dimensional friend groups. Instead, we get a tighter, more grounded narrative focused on family and the emotional gravity of loss, which gives the film an unexpected, if not revolutionary, layer of depth. This isn‚Äôt just about death hunting randos at a racetrack or on a rollercoaster anymore‚Ä¶ This is about legacy, guilt, and the painful ripple effects of tragedy across generations. That said, it‚Äôs not a reinvention of the wheel. The series‚Äô trademark death sequences are still the main course, and Bloodlines doesn‚Äôt transcend the occasional dumb decision or exposition dump. But you can sense that it‚Äôs trying to grow up. Death still doesn‚Äôt miss. But this time, you might actually care who it hits."

The editors did a great job with subliminal messaging, every shot mattered to the broader plot. The progression was a bit too predictable thought, they had 1 turn at the start where the main girl predicted the family tree wrong, but no more turns after that, which could‚Äôve elevated the movie. Will make your whole body sweat, your hands sweat. William Bludworth wasn‚Äôt developed enough as a character, could easily have seen him come back into play but he never did after dropping his clue. Big missed opportunity. Would have given this 4.5, but the ending was really really bad & engineered. Maybe the producers ran out of money or someone said ‚Äúwe need this to end in exactly this time‚Äù. Felt like the whole movie‚Äôs tension got thrown away.

Can they track down the source of why this is happening and survive? Death doesn‚Äôt like it when you mess with its plans because he also has a sick sense of humor It‚Äôs a large cast of unknowns but it also serves as the late Tony Todd‚Äôs final on screen appearance giving hopefully useful advice to Stefanie and her friends to cheat Death It‚Äôs an ongoing circle with fate coming back around to you, that‚Äôs how Death is presented here always cycling back This movie ended up being my favorite next to parts 2, 4, and 5 ‚ÄòBloodlines‚Äô was very entertaining and I was impressed by the grisly kills and the gore making you squirm in suspense not knowing the mechanics of how each of these victims bite the dust A wonderful combination of practical effects as well as CGI elements It has really nice sound editing as well making ordinary objects look and sound scary It was an impressive opening too taking place in one decade before shifting to the current one With this extended family they make them very likable despite being a large cast of unknowns I loved how they added to the mythos by certain rules they set up in previous entries trying to escape Death's design It was also very good to see Todd in one of his final performances and they give a reasonable explanation why he's been so integral to this franchise since it started I‚Äôm happy they tie back to previous entries too and some funny humor with even the characters being self conscious I have to say that the ending had the most impressive set piece to boot Minor holes in the story aside I can definitely see why this one is the best reviewed after 6 films because they know how to step up their game playing on certain fears and paranoia revitalizing the franchise It all boils down to which one is your favorite or they do it better than others following the same outline Could this truly be the end of the series? Lord only knows because Death is a constant thing coming after each and every one of us when we least expect it being powerless against the worlds morbid whims This honors the ‚ÄòFinal Destination‚Äô legacy making it a high point after 2 and half decades"

Every scene had a set up and pay off, this time around the character decisions all made sense. We never had characters making dumb decisions to set up a scene, this time you would easily understand every decision and it's logical nature.

Any rating that was ‚Äúfresh‚Äù with no numerical value was counted as 1, and any rating that was ‚Äúrotten‚Äù with no numerical value was counted as .3. It should be noted that there were few ‚Äúrotten‚Äù reviews with no number and many ‚Äúfresh‚Äù reviews with no number. Even with being generous and counting the many ‚Äúfresh‚Äù ratings with no further breakdown as 100%, the total number came out to 96.9 from 124 critics. That comes out to .78, or 78%.

I just enjoy the complicated \"Rube Goldberg\" -style \"accidental\" deaths, which feel like they were inspired by \"The Omen\" series, another favorite of mine. \" Final Destination: Bloodlines\" is a fun return for the series. It's gruesome and macabre, and the kills are inventive. It's pretty much played for Dark Comedy. The cast is competent but feel like they were plucked off the \"Discount\" shelf. The most recognizable actor is Brec Bassinger, star of The CW's \"Stargirl\", who figures in the film's outlandish prologue. The late, great Tony Todd bids farewell with a mournful cameo."

Personally, I feel like a death sequence is supposed to leave you terrified of being in a situation like that but, besides the Skyview, a lot if the deaths felt very unlikely to happen and almost forced. Years from now, I think the only deaths that I'll remember from this movie is from the beginning (maybe the lawnmower too RIP Uncle Howard). I wish writers made Stef more likeable and a better Lead. She's a great actress but the script didn't help. In future movies, give us a better protagonist and more supporting deuteragonist. Story wise: strong intro, OK middle, weak ending. Definitely not the best in the franchise but not the worst."

That film was the first I was able to see in theaters and it gave me a fear of roller coasters so bad that some still make me wince today (sorry Orlando, you won‚Äôt get me on Velocicoaster). That‚Äôs neither here nor there, the franchise has always been exciting. Even the unanimously disliked 4th entry had some exciting moments. Walking into the 6th film in the franchise, you sort of know what to expect, almost like‚Ä¶.a premonition‚Ä¶.. This movie was so, SO much fun in IMAX with a crowd of people who just as excited to see a new entry for the first time in over a decade. It delivered what I expected from this franchise but with a bit more emphasis on familial trauma that you‚Äôd expect in a drama than in the same franchise where a guy with a camera asks girls to flash him during a roller coaster loop. The family angle made it feel more focused even if it wasn‚Äôt exactly free of wonky CGI or plot hole storytelling. One highlight I can‚Äôt stress enough was that opening. Holy hell, you‚Äôd think they couldn‚Äôt one up 5‚Äôs epic bridge collapse but damn did this almost give titanic esque moments during its best moments. The kills were easily some of the most violent in the franchise and while the ending left more to be desired, I can‚Äôt help but smile knowing there‚Äôs likely more entries to come. A fun, fun time all around and definitely in the top 3 in the franchise."

Just a bunch of variations of the same old worn thing that's been done thousands of times before with the same character in a different mask. This is exactly why there are so many spoof films on the genre. However I have to acknowledge that this was not a simple slasher movie. In fact we never even see the slasher. Much like \" Jaws \" unintentionally did not always show the protagonist, which turned out to be much more impactful, we never see this villain. And \" the theatre of the mind\" is an awesome writer. It leaves the possibilities limitless. Instead of relying on easy to execute, simple to write cliche \" jump scares \", the writers cleverly used the films premise to create suspense and tease the audience to build you up with suspense , until unpredictably the unthinkable actually does occur. The tragic events were really well thought out, original and creative. There is a very fitting analogy to describe these scary scenes. It's the classic boardgame \" Mousetrap\" There are many series of well thought seemingly unconnected serendipitous evens that all connect and have to take place in the correct order to cause the unfortunate demise of the characters. And then the ball eventually drops in them. They dont just lose their noggins from a guy who jumps out of a closet with an ax accompanued by a few shrieking violin strokes. Nope, too easy for this crew . There was one scene early on remiscent of one of the most humorous scenes in \" Hitch hikers Guide To The Galaxy\". The scene where the cute little creature is exhuberantly overjoyed to see the ship land, then unexpectedly gets flattened by the ships door. That kind of humor. There is a perfect word in German to describe much of the laughs . This film is loaded with \" shadenfreude\". The joy derived by someone from the misfortune of others. The VFX, CGI and prosthetics are all first rate. So if you are a fan of the genre and a fan of well written and well executeddark humor, this one is for you. shouid like this one. Guaranteed to have a sequel."

It did a great job paying homage to the original movies, plenty of nods for longtime fans without feeling like a copy-paste. The tension builds up well, and the deaths were creative without being over-the-top. But what really got me was the ending, did not see that coming. A solid addition to the franchise that kept me hooked the whole way through."

However, as an avid fan of the Final Destination franchise this failed to meet expectations. The overload of CGI deaths, the pacing issues, and story that doesnt seem quite fleshed out places the 6th entry of the Final Destination near the bottom (still much better than Final Destination 4). There is still some things this film gets right which includes one of the best opening premonitions of the franchise, a great final performance of Tony Todd, and at least two great death sequences to add to the collection. Overall its a fun time and should be watched in theaters."

      "review": "\"Final Destination Bloodlines\" came out this weekend, and it is the 6th movie in the Final Destination franchise. It has been 14 years since the last one came out. This movie was directed by Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein, starring Kaitlyn Santa Juana, Teo Briones, and Rya Kihlstedt. This movie is about a family who has been marked by Death because their grandmother saved many people after seeing a premonition. After her death, her children and grandchildren must work together to try and escape their fate. Starting at the beginning, I really liked this opening premonition. They threw me off because it was a girl having a premonition of something that happened to her grandmother in the past. There were a variety of kills, and it took a little to get to the carnage. The kill sequences in this movie were also very good. I loved the rube-goldberg sequences. They were unique, and there were great fake-outs. This movie was the funniest so far to me due to the outrageous kills and strong cast. The family had a great dynamic, and they added to the humor. There is one character in particular that is very funny. Tony Todd also gave his final performance. We learned some background to his character, and it felt like a final goodbye to his fans. This negative doesn't have to do with the movie I think, but there were multiple scenes where the audio sounded off. I think it was the theater though. I hope so. We did not get new lore about Death or their design. It feels like a similar formula to the other movies, but I think it was better executed, for the most part. Like the other movies, this movie struggled with the ending. The third act is like 5 minutes long. It ended so suddenly, which is disappointing. Overall, \"Final Destination Bloodlines\" was a very good movie in this franchise. CGI gore may be hit or miss to some, but I thought it was fine. I recommend going to see this new one if you enjoyed the previous ones."

I really enjoyed the movie-though the CG at the beginning felt a bit off. Watching it, it feels like Death isn't just playing with the characters, but also with me, since I can never predict what's going to happen next. The director and screenwriter have captured the essence of the series while cleverly subverting its formulaic patterns. Even though we know none of the characters can escape death, the smart plot twists keep me guessing about who the next victim will be. That, to me, is what's great about this movie."
