      "review": "Mikey‚Äôs Film Review: Black Bag (2025) Directed by Steven Soderbergh (Out Of Sight, Ocean‚Äôs 11) and written by David Koepp (Mission: Impossible, Jurassic Park), Black Bag is a slow burning spy drama that has more in common with Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy than Mr. & Mrs. Smith‚Ä¶ When intelligence agent George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender) is tasked with finding the traitor amongst 5 suspects - one of which includes his wife Kathryn (Cate Blanchett), he soon discovers there could be much more than their marriage at risk. It‚Äôs Soderbergh and Koepp firing on all cylinders - beautifully shot and framed, and suffused with some deliciously juicy one-liners. The small but perfectly cast ensemble (including Marisa Abela, Tom Burke, Naomie Harris, Reg√©-Jean Page and Pierce Brosnan) engaging in confident, smart and sexy repartee with plenty of bite. The main character of George Woodhouse is most certainly based on and inspired by John le Carr√©‚Äôs George Smiley (so brilliantly played over the years by the likes of Alec Guinness and Gary Oldman). His cold, calculating and technical demeanour being the film's main focus and drive. Fassbender plays the legendary protagonist to perfection. With so much of modern Hollywood‚Äôs output relying on established IP and remakes, it‚Äôs good to know that there are still auteurs trying to create original content without the need for fast editing, gunfire and explosions every 30 seconds - even if it is with a slightly worn genre throwback. Black Bag is as slick as they come and at 90 minutes perfectly rounded. It‚Äôs also proof that yes indeed, they do ‚Äòmake them like they used to‚Äô‚Ä¶ Mikey‚Äôs Film Rating: 4/5*"

      "review": "If you fed Out of Sight, The Informant!, and Haywire into a paper shredder and reassembled them with surgical precision, you might end up with something like Black Bag. And I say that as someone who‚Äôs spent far too much time rewatching The Limey with director commentary on. Black Bag is pure Soderberghian catnip‚Äîstylish, cerebral, and just slippery enough to make you lean forward. It‚Äôs a stripped-down spy thriller that doesn‚Äôt shout its intelligence but whispers it, cool and confident. The pacing is tight, the editing is propulsive, and the camera moves like it‚Äôs got somewhere better to be. What sets it apart isn‚Äôt the espionage‚Äîit‚Äôs the vibe. There's a formalism to the filmmaking that feels both classic and completely modern. The color palette‚Äôs cold but clean. The score hums with minimalist menace. Scenes bleed into each other with a jazzy rhythm, like a Miles Davis solo re-cut by an algorithm. You feel the influence of Contagion and Side Effects‚Äînot in plot, but in tone: clinical, efficient, and always two steps ahead. The performances? Deceptively low-key, which is the point. These aren‚Äôt Bond characters. They‚Äôre real professionals in real trouble. There‚Äôs no exposition dump‚Äîjust context clues and clipped conversations that demand attention. You‚Äôre not being spoon-fed; you‚Äôre being invited to keep up. And like all great Soderbergh joints, Black Bag trusts its audience. It knows we‚Äôve seen the tropes. It‚Äôs not reinventing the spy genre‚Äîit‚Äôs streamlining it, polishing it, and handing it back to us with a smirk and a burner phone. Black Bag doesn‚Äôt need explosions to feel dangerous. It plays like a sealed envelope that might be empty‚Äîor might ruin lives. You won‚Äôt know until the last scene. And when the credits hit, you‚Äôll want to start it all over‚Äîjust to catch what you missed the first time."

Black Bag is a sophisticated espionage thriller that revolves around George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender), a senior British intelligence officer tasked with uncovering a mole within his agency. One investigation takes a deeply personal turn when one of the suspects is George's wife, Kathryn (Cate Blanchett), also a high-ranking spy. The narrative unfolds through tense interrogations, manipulative dinner parties, and psychological warfare, creating a slow-burn mystery filled with twists and emotional complexity Michael Fassbender delivers a gripping performance as George, portraying the internal conflict of loyalty to his country versus doubts about his wife with subtlety and precision. Cate Blanchett shines as Kathryn, balancing warmth and menace in her enigmatic portrayal Their chemistry is electric, romance and deep emotion for each other . The supporting cast, including Reg√©-Jean Page, Naomie Harris, Tom Burke, and Marisa Abela, adds layers to the story with their nuanced performances. Steven Soderbergh masterfully directs Black Bag we all know him ocean 11, 12 & 13 his style and charm blending sleek cinematography with fast-paced editing to heighten suspense. His use of soft-focus shots and wide-angle lenses creates an atmosphere of danger and uncertainty. Soderbergh avoids typical spy genre clich√©s, focusing instead on realism and psychological tension. The dinner scenes are particularly noteworthy for their manipulative brilliance, showcasing Soderbergh's ability to build suspense through dialogue and subtle interactions rather than action sequences One thing always best in how he use Jazz. The film's score complements its minimalist aesthetic perfectly. There was many good score of Jazz in Ocean trilogy too . A mix of jazzy undertones and percussive beats creates an atmospheric backdrop that enhances the tension without overpowering the narrative. The restrained yet evocative music mirrors the film's focus on psychological drama over flashy action. Black Bag is an intelligent and stylish espionage thriller that transcends genre conventions. With stellar performances from Fassbender and Blanchett, sharp direction by Soderbergh, and a compelling narrative rooted in themes of trust and manipulation, it offers a refreshing take on spy cinema. The film‚Äôs focus on psychological tension rather than action. Highly recommended"

Instead what I got was a bunch of people having dinner or going to meetings to figure out who of their small group was a traitor. The trailers mad you suspect Cate Blanchett was the traitor. Not for a second did I believe that. There was no action save for the end where the young up and coming spy turned out tot be the traitor gets shot. What boring POS!!"

However, he never envisioned anything as boring as this. The reveal at the end could have been any of them, and the black bagged person would have elicited the same dead eyed audience reaction.

When a government software program by the name of Severus gets stolen, George's boss Philip (Gustaf Skarsg√•rd) asks him to investigate the rat within their house. However, there's a small problem: one of the 5 people George is tasked to investigate is his loving wife Kathryn. Will George put his marriage over his career and country or is he love for her deeper than all of that? The story makes for quite the conundrum and Fassbender takes the bull by the horns with his portrayal of George, who is an extremely intelligent man who can spot a liar without a polygraph (it should also be noted as part of George's job is in fact to perform polygraphs as well). Like many others who are incredibly intelligent, George lacks any type of human emotion and empathy, coming off as robotic at times, but Fassbender still plays the crap out of it. I believed his affection for Kathryn more than I believed her affection towards him. Although lacking emotion George's feelings towards Kathryn seem genuine while hers come off as manipulative at times. The other standout performance for me was from Marisa Abela who plays Clarissa, another of the 5 suspects George is tasked with investigating. She's unapologetic in regards to the life she lives and the choices she's made. She's outspoken, speaks up for herself, and doesn't sugarcoat her feelings. The film is concise and tight, never dragging or feeling bloated for the sake of a specified runtime. Like any good spy, director Steven Soderbergh is in and out without overstaying his welcome. He's got another hit on his hands here."

The best way to shut down someone breaking the law at work is to report it, and I have to believe that spies would do this for sure. It would not be hard to unplug someone who is going off the rails. And that's what they should do, so you really have to suspend reality to go along with the story line. But IF you can believe it, you'll have a fun ride, and as I said, it's smart and well-acted."

Dark shadowy lighting, murky sets, cliche secret meetings in cellars and alleyways. Too much simplistic wooden dialogue yet speeches hard to follow or to even HEAR.

There are a lot of nods to that movie in this one--heck, the main character is a soft spoken spy named George who wears thick rimmed glasses! I appreciated the realism they tried to sprinkle in, although juxtaposed with completely ridiculous parts was counterproductive the verisimilitude they were trying to build. My main issue with the film is that I don't think it did a great job at a slow burning build up of knowledge and tension while the mole's plot was being pieced together. So overall the movie fell a little flat for me. The other problem I had was too much interpersonal drama and handwringing over relationships--to be fair that's one of the main themes of the film, but they overdid it IMO. Bottom line: it wasn't an awful movie, but it's also no Tinker Tailor."

I give you, ‚ÄúBLACK BAG‚Äù. Directed by the genius STEVEN SODERBERGH, and written by DAVID KOEPP. The cast isn‚Äôt just fabulous, it‚Äôs superb, in a film that‚Äôs a classy, slick, and a stylish ‚ÄúWHO DUN IT?‚Äù All British cast(my favorite), with MICHAEL FASSBENDER as ‚ÄúGEORGE‚Äù, who steals the show, as he usually does, and CATE BLANCHETT as ‚ÄúKATHRYN‚Äù, his wife. The chemisty between them Is beautiful, and also the crux of the movie, will you put your marriage or your country first? Also PIERCE BROSNAN as ‚ÄúAUTHUR‚Äù, who does his usual bang up job as the head of the British intelligence. Only 1 hour and 33 minutes, but it never feels short because it starts immediately, and never lets you go. The beginning scene with all the characters at the dinner table Is a thing of beauty, the way It‚Äôs written and directed, and It sets the scene beautifully for the rest If the movie. An old fashion spy drama, that felt like it came from the 60‚Äôs, or 70‚Äôs. Where every single character could be the villain, and you never find out until the very end. Written beautifully, directed fabulously, with camera angles that would make ‚ÄúMISSION IMPOSSIBLE‚Äù and TOM CRUISE blush, and MICHAEL FASSBENDER steals the show yet again. It‚Äôs more about the spies themselves, their intimate lives, and how they try to separate their lethal jobs and their normal lives, then the devices, mission, and action."

Fassbender did this with more depth in The Agency. Cate was CIA in Hanna. I do not mind a slow burn intellectual thriller, and I love the idolized style of a spy's life, but at the end of the day this didn't break new ground or put some actors together for a vanity project the audience was craving like Wolfs. This would have been better suited for a direct to streaming. And lastly, casting Marisa Abela in that role is lazy.

It was a complex situation they were developing and without good clear words to help understand it was pretty close to impossible to make much sense out of much of what was going on. Blackmail, marital breakups, back stabbing, etc. Maybe this is what spy's do with their free time and it's just me that doesn't get it.... They kept trying to tie Russia into the personal relations between these people who I am guessing were all spies for the English government.

Good production values and a very good cast line up are just not enough to make up for the dull script and poor execution of quite a well worn story line of \"we've a mole, so who is it?\" The opening sequence of this film is an overlong dinner table event soaked in melodrama and a wholly unbelieveable moment of violence by one of the protagonists. The film grinds and groans on as each of the characters is \"framed\" as being a suspect in this free of any suspense tale. Not even close to the thriller that this is suposed to be. It's a 94 minute exercise in testing the patience of a viewer. The immediate cinema comparison is Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy which was outstanding. Here, there seemed no onscreen chemistry between any of the characters; not helped by the fact that none of the characters were that likeable. Just a bunch of sad people in a sad business. Blanchett et al can't be proud of this. Neither can Soderbergh who has produced some really good films among his previous 33 cinema efforts. Naomie Harris - her of the silky smooth voice in the Bond franchise - was cast as a lass from the North. Her wobbling accent placed her as being from Manchester, Leeds and Tyneside (linguistically, hugely different UK Regions) in the space of just a few minutes. Tom Burke's efforts were also cringe inducing. So, it's not about money and it's not about the cast line-up - this film just missed the targets. I sat through this for just over the hour and actually missed the end, preferring a quick one in the pub before driving home. But, d'you know what? I couldn't have cared less what happened in the end."
