    "review": "The Substance est une ≈ìuvre radicale, d√©rangeante, et visc√©ralement engag√©e. Elle ne plaira clairement pas √† tout le monde, et c‚Äôest tant mieux. Ce film ne cherche pas √† caresser dans le sens du poil : il choque, il bouscule, mais surtout, il interroge. C‚Äôest une satire sanglante et provocante de notre obsession de la jeunesse, un miroir cruel tendu √† une soci√©t√© obs√©d√©e par l‚Äôapparence, la performance, et la perfection. Visuellement frappant, narrativement os√©, The Substance s‚Äôimpose comme une exp√©rience cin√©matographique presque organique, √† ne pas mettre entre toutes les mains, mais √† ne surtout pas ignorer. Cela dit, si le propos est fort, la derni√®re partie verse dans un gore outrancier, presque gratuit. On comprend la volont√© de choquer, mais √† ce stade, le message √©tait d√©j√† pass√©, et cette surench√®re visuelle risque de faire d√©crocher certains spectateurs. Un peu plus de retenue dans le final n‚Äôaurait pas enlev√© d‚Äôimpact au contraire. Malgr√© cette d√©rive sanglante, The Substance reste un film audacieux, ambitieux et visc√©ralement moderne."

    "review": "Excellent acting, cinematography, editing, and especially make-up! Not a single thing in this movie was done poorly, and even the weaker elements were held-up by the excellence of all the other moving parts. It has a very lucid and dreamlike quality which makes the more real aspects ever more haunting. The film is a body horror movie, and while it does have excellently grotesque special and practical effects, it revels in its ability to make even the normal human body seem horrid in the eyes of the characters. Every shot of normal body parts and functions are shot in such a way as to make us experience the characters' disgust in it. A body horror movie which manages to make the normal seem grotesque. The ending, while intentionally made this way, does get to a point where the camp overshadows any last semblance of horror it had, despite being in theory the most horrifying entity thus far; though the ending was quite spectacular even so."

I was curious how the film would end given how long it is, and I think it made sense the way everything wrapped up. I don't entirely agree with those saying the ending was chaos, but i do feel the movie went on for 20-40 minutes longer than it probably should have. There were some comical moments here, original concepts I've never seen before, and scenes that were truly novel that will stick with me for a while hereafter."

    "review": "The Nutty Professor meets Dorian Gray, poorly. Both stories handle body dismorphia and beauty standards and its impact on an individual's self-worth, the desire to fit in and to be accepted, driving the proganist to drastic measures by using unapproved and dangerous substances. In both stories, the main character is doing huge damage to their own life, in order to provide for a parasite that despises and antagonizes it's host. The difference is, one of the movies is self-aware. It does not intend to be anything else but light entertainment. The suspension of disbelief is granted because the storyline is not trying to be realistic in any sense. For the most part, it consists of overacting and simplified, irrational behaviour on part of the side characters in order to give the main actor more room. But the film always stays true to it's premise. It is advertised as a lighthearded comedy and is stringent in that. It does not take itself seriously at all. And most importantly, professor Klump has a clear motivation to keep the parasite going: approaching his love interest. And, although the narrrative is inconsistent, it seems that at least in the beginning he shares the same experiences and thoughts with his parasite, is able to live through him. In The Substance on the other hand, there is no motivation at all for the main character Elisabeth to keep going with this. Why would she keep on letting the parasite suck the remaining life out of her when apparently she has no connection to her feelings, doesn't see through her eyes, doesn't seem to have any benefit whatsoever from the situation. The substance starts off as serious movie. It has it's satirical moments at times, but mostly it is presenting itself as a suspenseful, pychologycal body-horror movie with a message. Adding to that is Demi Moore, approaching the role with a sort of seriousness and sadness that is captivating, yet doesn't match the overarching tone of the film at all. Almost all of the characters around her act as stereotypical parodies of what they are supposed to represent, i.e. the abusively creepy neighbour, the non-chalant, disgusting producer and his greedy investors, or the passersby that are hostile to anyone above 50. Most men are displayed as complete jerks, most women purely as sexual objects. Margaret Qualley plays along in the role of the parasite whose sole character trait is having the body of a young, attractive woman. While her portrayal of the character as shallow and enticing fits the narrative and overall tone, it just doesn't leave much of an impression. Only Dennis Quaid really shines here. Maybe he understood the sillyness of the story from the get go and just played along with it. He fills every scene with comedic energy and over-the-top acting that fits perfectly into the silly plot. Ah yes, and then there's what could be interpreted as an homage to Oscar Wilde's Picture of Dorian Gray. Only here, the picture stays the same while the character gets uglier and more misfigured with every scene, being the result of complete self-abuse. It conveys with the message that is hammered into the audience's ears all through the movie: \"you can only be yourself. Your actions have consequences\". Futher on the topic of homages, there's an obvious reference to Stephen King's Carrie in the very painful to watch final chapter of the story. The level of grotesque and stupidity of these concluding 20 minutes drags the film down from mediocre to outright terrible. So while on the surface The Nutty Professor and The Substance have nothing in common, they are both a similarly unrealistic and exaggerated critique of societal standards . But the former doesnt pretend to be anything else than lowbrow family entertainment with fart jokes, while the latter aims at something it fails to achieve, coming off as pretentious. One star for the amazing, innovative cinematography and Dennis Quaid as the disgusting producer. Zero stars for anything else."

    "review": "The substance movie is known as a horror/science fiction movie. It is one of the excellent examples of how a movie can include entertainment elements in itself so that people stay awake and how at the same time artistic elements (Form and the way movie is shot) can be simply layered within it. In my opinion, This movie is essential for every one of us to watch not because of its entertainment respects, but because of how it reminds us of what humanity really mean, why we should get to know ourselves, how greed for fame or anything can lead us to wrong routes, and so on. This is a simple story of a Materialist woman who is suffering from a mental disorder - she wants to be seen and admired by people; she wants to be loved by people - not herself, as in self-love. We are not shown a lot of locations, unnecessary details and scenes; what we watch clearly shows us the point of the story and this is done skilfully by the storytelling and directing power of Coralie Fargeat, and via the movement of camera by the cinematographer. The movie is full of great compositions and color choices. For example, when at the end of the movie a huge amount of blood is split on the audience, there is a symbol of how what we people and producers want from celebrities ‚Äì Beauty of their appearance and high expectations ‚Äì seems as if we shed their bloods and make them sacrifice their life for nothing. Additionally, the beginning and ending of the movie were at the same spot, and it made a parenthetical start and end, which very well depicted how the main character chose her life to be as worth as a little inscribed Hollywood star on a floor. In the 9th episode ‚Äì Mean Seasons ‚Äì of ‚ÄúBatman the new animated series‚Äù, season one, the villain is very similar to the main character of this movie and in terms of the development of the character, it could be inspired by this episode. Actings are great starting from the main role, Demi Moore, to the side roles such as Dennis Quaid. Moral lessons and principles are evident and understood after watching the movie; for instance, do not disturb nature. If something is not done by any good means, it is not for you. The nasty side of Hollywood is also criticised. What makes the film not to be a perfect one is that It exaggerates action and violent scenes in a too frightening, disgusting, and aggressive way. Besides, the fiction seems to be too much as it's hard to beleive someone can emerge from somebody's back. Overall, apart from all of us, this movie is so much recommended to those who are working in the entertainment industry. A lot of efforts has been put and this has resulted in a very good and simple outcome. If you're a fan of science fiction/horror movies, this film is for you."

This work is an extraordinary critique of the contemporary show business world, with the theme of ‚Äúthe double‚Äù handled with an almost obsessive precision.

I'm not surprised to learn it was directed by (I presume) a lesbian seeing that it depicts most men as stereotypically grotesque, but it doesn't exactly make pretty women look great either (morally - Margaret Qualley is clearly a ten physically).

Demi Moore‚Äôs performance for the first 40 minutes or so was the lone bright spot‚Äîshe is still gorgeous and still a star, though that made it harder in many ways to buy the storyline.

This overwhelming fear of age in show business, the willingness to improve yourself at any cost, only to be forced to come to terms with the dreadful ramifications those costs actually entail. The relentless and heartless meat grinder of Hollywood, magnified ten times for young and older women alike. Of all the revolting gore and nightmarish body horror, including my literal groan of distress when her tooth came out, I still think the msot disgusting part of the film was the producer.

But the story had me pulled in the whole time. Gross, but I kept looking, anyway. I rented it, so I made sure to watch it twice in 48 hours to catch what I may have missed. The second time around, I did turn my head on the parts I knew were going to be gross and disturbing. But that is something the director felt the movie needed. I'm okay with that for this kind of story. It fits here. Still disturbing, but appropriate for the art form."

The movie make an intelligent critique about how the media valorize young women and the old people are put aside like they're not useful anymore.

However, it relies too much on grotesque body horror, often feeling excessive rather than meaningful. The constant, almost voyeuristic focus on female bodies‚Äîthrough lingering, unnecessary shots‚Äîfeels less like a statement and more like indulgence.

    "review": "So, I finally got around to watching The Substance, and let me tell you, it's a wild ride. Directed by Coralie Fargeat, this film is a bold mix of body horror and dark comedy that takes a hard look at society's obsession with youth and beauty. It's not for the faint-hearted, but if you're into movies that push boundaries, this one's worth your time. The story centers on Elisabeth, played by Demi Moore, an aging Hollywood star desperate to reclaim her former glory. She turns to an experimental drug that promises to restore her youth, but things go horribly wrong, leading to a series of grotesque and darkly comedic events. Moore's performance is nothing short of fearless; she dives deep into the role, unafraid to showcase vulnerability and vanity in equal measure. It's arguably one of her best performances in years. Visually, the film is both stunning and disturbing. Fargeat doesn't shy away from graphic imagery, using it to satirize the lengths to which people will go to maintain their youth. The cinematography is sharp, and the special effects are impressively unsettling, adding to the film's overall impact. However, The Substance isn't without its flaws. Some critics feel that the film's approach to its themes lacks subtlety, making its commentary on aging and beauty standards feel heavy-handed. Additionally, the film's intense and graphic content may not sit well with all viewers, potentially overshadowing its underlying messages. Despite these issues, I found The Substance to be a daring and thought-provoking film. It challenges societal norms and forces viewers to confront the often grotesque nature of our obsession with appearance. If you can stomach the gore and appreciate dark satire, this film offers a unique cinematic experience that's hard to forget."

But the grotesque last third of the movie does not do it credit. Filled with deplorable nude scenes (which could have been done more effectively), transformation of the monster spewing blood across the audience, a breast falling out of the monster, and I could go on forever. It is not the type of movie I would recommend."

The film's artificial production design and reliance on shock value overshadow its intended commentary, resulting in a viewing experience that feels more punishing than enlightening. While Demi Moore's portrayal of Elisabeth Sparkle offers moments of depth, the narrative's lack of subtlety and excessive focus on body horror diminish the film's overall impact. Instead of providing a nuanced exploration of societal pressures, \"The Substance\" devolves into a spectacle that is challenging to endure, leaving viewers more repulsed than reflective."

The bigger problem is that the film becomes so absurd by the end that it feels like it's not the same movie at all. The film is a very good piece in the bodyhorror category and its elements are very well illustrated. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves bodyhorror because let's be honest this movie is pretty disgusting.

However, the idea of the transforming scene and the monster in the end is very weird and unrelated to the concept. It isn't really a horror movie but also have some thrilling scenes. The ending is probably the worst. There are just too many things happened but not many things to understand. It's just like a fever dream. The characteristic of each character is clear and realistic. There are character developments along the movie also. There are also many mirror scenes which shows the act of self-reflection of the character. The actor's portrayal of the character is very realistic and admiring. The emotions expression is also great. Overall, this movie might not be the best option for everyone.

It's never really clear if the main character lives the life of her clone. If she does you can understand why she would want to go through all this but it seems like she doesn't and they are completely different people, so the whole plot doesn't make sense. A little dialogue would have gone a long way. The clone servers no purpose to her, none. Like I said it isn't clear so I couldn't enjoy the movie. Then in the end it's just cheesy and stupid.

I was captivated by its concept, particularly the initial horror and sci-fi elements surrounding the idea of a shared (or not shared?) consciousness. The film‚Äôs visuals and satirical edge effectively challenge the absurdity of age-defying expectations placed on women. However, as the story progresses, its absurdity, gore, and plot unravel into something closer to an acid trip than a symbolic horror. I found myself wanting more from Demi Moore‚Äôs older counterpart, whose presence felt underutilized. While the film embraces its sci-fi nature, the sparse dialogue left The Substance ironically lacking in substance, and what dialogue remained often felt so bizarre it could have been written by a third grader. I‚Äôm glad to have seen it for the buzz, but it‚Äôs not one I‚Äôll be revisiting."

It's equally about how self-destructive Hollywood female superficiality can be. Moore's character is a narcissistic jackass, like many an actor was, is, and always will be. She's not supposed to be especially sympathetic. That said, if someone suggests the movie is profound either in form or content, that person is revealing himself or herself as not understanding profundity. Shallow cannot perceive deep. The film slams you in the face with its message, and that message has no original insights. It's a 90 IQ film for a 100 IQ audience. The story itself is not terrible, but a few points. The writer/director knows less than nothung about biology, so much of the film is unintentionally hilarious. Not uncommon for scifi, but outrageous ignorance never deserves much consideration. She tries to distract from the absurdity with insane levels of gore. That will titillate the juvenile and disgust the mature. The acting is solid, except Quaid's. He is a live-action cartoon villain. The best uses of this film are to learn about the mentality and limitations of its reviewers, and to test how mamy exploding heads you can stomach."

Absolute harmony between production design and the score - otherwise this would be a bad Barbie spinoff. It deals with much of the same ideas as Barbie, but in a much more grotesque way. What Kraƒçun (cinematographer) does with the camera... ... ... The shots degrade in stability as Elizabeth's psyche gets split in two. The fish-eye effect is used with perfection. The perspective shots are reeling. No notes. Fargeat's previous work on Reality+ is like the conceptual draft for The Substance. Looking at her body of work, you can tell this is something she dwells on and takes seriously. The Substance is classified as horror... but it's not that kind of horror. It's psychological, a thriller. It gets graphic, no doubt... but if you understand the meaning... this hits you like a ton of bricks. The New Year's Eve party scene became over the top very quickly, in that it dragged on far too long, past the point it was trying to make. The whole film is ingenuous. Conceptually raw. Unashamedly IN YOUR FACE. A commentary on the addiction to beauty, the emptiness of vanity, and the sexualization of people. The story is about a woman... but if you're watching closely, it's applicable to anyone. ... freaking insane. The third act weakens a bit. It doesn't go where you'd expect it to take you, but if you haven't gone back to Amazon Prime and picked a different movie to watch, then you are already hooked and a long for the ride. The Substance is supposed to make to kinda freak out about what you're seeing. It's supposed to make you cringe, say \"oh my god\" and \"holy sh**\". It's designed to rip off the commercialization of beauty and show us what's it's really doing to our society, our bodies, our minds. It does all of this and more. A moment to talk briefly about nudity in film - THIS is what using nudity with PURPOSE looks like. There were some shots that were pointless, and some of its too in-your-face for my taste, but it's also supposed to be... That transformation scene in the bathroom... there are a ton of films that need to take notes here. Moore is... shocking, as Elizabeth Sparkle. She drags you on a journey down the path of obsession with image. Too many people are so far down this path already... the pursuit of perfect image turning them into monsters instead of of models. Love yourself. That is the cry of this film. Love who you are, as you are. That is what will free you. Love yourself, because He first love you. You don't need any substance to give you the better version of yourself, besides healthy food, sunlight, and water. You don't need anything to feel beautiful... accept who God made you to be, and you will have everything you need. Love who you see in the mirror... because God does."

And though the message is aimed towards women aging, the director did a great job and allowing the film to resonate with everyone. As a 30 yr old male I did a lot of reflecting myself after seeing this!"

Those with a good theater system will appreciate the excellent sound design. Great film, glad I chose to see it in theater."

    "review": "With a strong sense of irony, the interesting premise and heavy meta narrative still lack substance. As it becomes increasingly difficult to separate actor and role the meta narrative of an aging star in the film being played by an actual aging star does much of the heavy lifting in the narrative. Particularly when it comes to the stark and scenes of Elisabeth (Moore) examining her body in the mirror being mirrored by the (near perverse) audiences attention on the bodies and imperfections of starlets. Similarly the comparisons of young and old bodies that have mainstays in the everyday conversations and societal norms are challenged by the themes of the film. However, the film in my opinion does not go far enough to explore the wider commentary and themes of the our older selves \"paying for the sins\" of our younger selves. The world we are shown is noticeably narrow and Elisabeth seemingly has no \"life\" to speak of outside of her work. If this was the intention of the filmmakers it should have been expressed more deftly. At present the film just feels empty because of budgetary issues rather than a stylistic choice. We see a vignette of a world when it would be far more meaningful to see wider consequences and character interactions. Moore, Qualley and Quaid all do well in their respective roles, though sadly the acting chops drop off a cliff beyond this trio which also hints at a lack of budget and a potential explanation why it wasn't possible to deliver a grander vision. If the Substance had Megalopolis Money it could have been a masterpiece rather than a quirky side show."

    "review": "This movie was phonomenal; an amazing take on aging, celebrity culture, modernity, and self-perception as a woman. It also examines what the 'self' is, compared against many different things. I tend to not like many modern movies, but this might be one of my favorite movies EVER; the body horror in this is enough to leave a horror fanatic nauseous. It does get pretty messed-up in certain scenes, so if you're not a fan of body horror, blood (and arguably gore), or injections, stay away. The suspense in this movie is also amazing--it's edge-of-your-seat tension all throughout. The editing is great; I love the contrast between Elisabeth as Sue and Elisabeth as Elisabeth. One thing I think could've been done better is the contrast. In some scenes, it's a bit difficult to understand what's going on due to dark lighting combined with low contrast. However, such scenes are few and far between. I have to agree with the more critical reviews that the ending seemed a bit over-the-top, but what isn't in this film? Quick warning before I end the review; this movie is NOT for everyone. You have to be a seasoned fan of 'weird' horror to get this, in my opinion. I wouldn't be surprised if most people just thought it was something made for the mentally deranged."

For me, there were so many ways to look at the film. Things that came to mind were the ever-expanding market for plastic surgery and the risk of deformation, and the messages we tell our young women and men: you lose value as you age. I particularly liked the scene with the \"shareholders\" - hilarious. For me, it was a sad, sometimes angering, but at the same time life affirming movie. I've read some other reviews commenting negatively on the hyper-fixation on Sue's body, but I found it in line with Coralie Fargeat's style. It's also a body horror film where the body is the main focus, so why wouldn't we also be focusing on Sue's body?"

Perdem a m√£o em efeitos e a conclus√£o deixa o filme com um Q pitoresco que n√£o agrega com a narrativa que se cria. O roteiro √© mal feito, a dire√ß√£o √© fraca, mas a critica sexista, etarista √© pesada e fica vis√≠vel mesmo sendo trabalhada de forma natural mas nada sutil. A atua√ß√£o da Demi Moore √© fraca, pra mim deveria agradecer e muito a indica√ß√£o para o Oscar. Franca porque n√£o tem consist√™ncia, ela come√ßa morna e poderia ter entregue muito muito e at√© mesmo levantado mais o filme e problemas como os que eu citei talvez seriam irrelevantes. A atua√ß√£o dela s√≥ fica realmente not√°vel e distinta no √°pice final e ai j√° √© tarde demais. Fotografia do filma claramente √© machista e tenta a todo custo objetificar as atrizes, mas essa √© a proposta, ent√£o se seguiu a proposta ta de parab√©ns, mas no contexto geral √© pobre, ruim, mais do mesmo. Parece filmado de uma Galaxy Pocket. Cen√°rios mal elaboradores, longos corredores, recursos que parecem ter sido reaproveitados de outra set em set. Faltou criatividade na constru√ß√£o de cen√°rio, s√≥ mudou os papeis de parede, o que me faz acreditar que abusaram do CGI. Not√°vel emprego demasiado de recursos em maquiagem e recurso escasso para o restante do projeto. Maquiagem final impec√°vel! Sem retoques! Alias, poderia ser menos excede no l√∫dico. Ah, o excesso no uso de recursos sonoros (som dos personagens mastigando), gera agonia e repousa do personagem, ajuda na constru√ß√£o do estere√≥tipo do etarista principal."

Desparate because somebody seems to have figured out the story had no intelligent or creative pathway forward. So‚Ä¶.more annd better gore. Qualley and Moore did a really good job for the most part, but I‚Äôm glad the academy chose to not give Moore an Oscar for this. It would have been like giving one to Faye Dunnaway (a much much better actress) for going over the top so severely in Mommy Dearest.

The young actress looks great in an 1980s inspired workout outfit. You get to see some (honestly for a horror fan rather tame) body horror. And for the most part the actors do a decent job hamming it up with the silly script. But everything else about this movie makes it a giant waste of anyone's time. I had this movie recommended to me because I love horror movies. And who doesn't enjoy a good satire? But sadly this movie's plot is so contrived and self-indulgent, a viewer has to forget instantly character motivations the movie sets up for the story to make sense.

    "review": "Despu√©s de a√±os de ausencia de la gran pantalla, Demi Moore regreso nuevamente con una obra maestra moderna del cine de terror que retrata la lucha interna que muchos sufren al tratar de encajar en una sociedad donde lo √∫nico que importa es la apariencia externa. The Substance es una refrescante pel√≠cula de horror corporal que act√∫a como una cruda s√°tira sobre c√≥mo los est√°ndares de belleza han hecho que se valorice m√°s la apariencia por encima de la individualidad. Coralie Fargeat presenta una deslumbrante visi√≥n que toma inspiraci√≥n de David Cronenberg y la plasma en una experiencia cinematogr√°fica bastante deslumbrante. Los planos y la fotograf√≠a no son lo √∫nico admirable, la directora hace acercamientos de primer plano y un acertado uso del sonido para generar sensaciones. La banda sonora de Raffertie es una magistral composici√≥n que tiene bastante glamour. La pel√≠cula tiene un sabor √∫nico que no se ha visto en otras pel√≠culas y se siente muy fresca. A pesar de abordar un tema que otras pel√≠culas han tocado, la manera en que lo hace le da bastante originalidad. El maquillaje que se usa para la belleza de Sue y el decaimiento de Elisabeth es asombroso. Nada m√°s se usaron unos toques de CGI, pero el maquillaje es admirable al nivel de muchas pel√≠culas de los a√±os 80. Podr√≠a decirse que la historia en s√≠ es bastante sencilla, pero el mensaje de la pel√≠cula y el profundo desarrollo de ambas protagonistas le da bastante potencia. Aunque Elisabeth y Sue son la misma persona, el desprecio que Elizabeth siente y el deseo de tener la aprobaci√≥n de los dem√°s por medio de la perfecci√≥n, dan lugar a que Sue se manifieste como un doppelganger. La pel√≠cula se convierte en una historia similar a Jekyll & Hyde, pero tirando m√°s por el lado de The Nutty Professor. Para entender la comparaci√≥n, The Substance es protagonizada por una mujer que es descartada por ser una mujer mayor y no tener juventud. Algo que es ir√≥nico, pues Demi Moore a√∫n es atractiva a pesar de tener unos 60 a√±os. El punto aqu√≠ es que Elisabeth vive en una sociedad donde la belleza es un producto que se puede explotar y cuando se gasta, termina siendo desechado. Dicha sociedad implanta la idea de que para poder encajar y ser valorado, hay que cumplir obligatoriamente los est√°ndares de belleza que la sociedad demanda para ganar un alto prestigio. Al ser una mujer de 50 a√±os, Elisabeth es desechada y eso hace que ella deje de sentirse valorada provoc√°ndole un vac√≠o existencial. The Nutty Professor de Eddie Murphy no est√° lejos de esta idea sobre tener que ser bello para sentirse aceptado. En esa pel√≠cula, Sherman Klump es un hombre con sobrepeso que se siente infravalorado y menospreciado por su f√≠sico. Eso lo lleva a recurrir a la f√≥rmula que lo convierte en un joven viril con excelente f√≠sico. Con The Substance pasa lo mismo cuando Elisabeth decide recurrir a La Sustancia para convertirse en la bella Sue. Ambas personajes simbolizan el conflicto interno que la protagonista siente y sus dos versiones se convierten en dos personalidades separadas. Elisabeth empieza a envidiar a Sue por su belleza y la admiraci√≥n que est√° recibiendo y cuando decide terminar con ella, no puede porque se convierte en su √∫nico medio para tener la aceptaci√≥n de los dem√°s. Esto ya ser√≠a una met√°fora de ese ser que muchos fingimos ser en los medios o en las redes para tener la aprobaci√≥n de los dem√°s. Fingiendo ser algo que no somos en realidad, pero acabamos siendo dependientes de esa imagen para no perder nuestro lugar en la sociedad. Sue siente desprecio hacia Elisabeth porque ella es esa vejez que muchas mujeres que se sienten perfectas o que se preocupan por su aspecto no desean. Ella es la materializaci√≥n de ese autodesprecio que Elisabeth se tiene. Sue es ese sentimiento de negaci√≥n hacia el envejecimiento y que siempre quiere vivir en la ilusi√≥n de ser eternamente bella. El monstruo que surge en los √∫ltimos minutos de pel√≠cula aun con ese sue√±o de ser admirada hasta el final, completa la met√°fora de esta pel√≠cula. Claro que hay momentos humor√≠sticos que pueden rayar en lo absurdo. La escena del portero puede parecer il√≥gica, pero no se sabe si eso realmente paso al ver a la criatura ilusionando con el recibimiento que tanto anhela. Tras toda la analog√≠a, La Sustancia a la que Elisabeth recurre es claramente una met√°fora sobre los cosm√©ticos y las cirug√≠as a las que las personas se exponen para mantener esa belleza perfecta que no quieren perder. Al no aceptar que todos envejecemos, ya sea por vanidad o por depender bastante de la aprobaci√≥n de los dem√°s, no aprendemos a aceptarnos tal como somos. Eso lleva a que terminemos recurriendo a m√©todos que pueden ser da√±inos para nuestra salud y llevarnos a nuestra propia destrucci√≥n. The Substance refleja c√≥mo las j√≥venes que desean encajar en una sociedad superficial acaban recurriendo a productos o cirug√≠as para perfeccionar sin importar los riesgos de salud. M√°s a√∫n en una generaci√≥n donde las ni√±as j√≥venes desean alcanzar la belleza perfecta usando cosm√©ticos para adultos que pueden perjudicar su salud. La estrella de Elisabeth al inicio y al final de la pel√≠cula dejan en claro que a esta sociedad no le importa nuestra salud, ya que solo nos ve como consumidores o simples productos. The Substance acaba siendo una asombrosa pel√≠cula que sabe transmitir una cruda realidad sobre nuestra sociedad y demuestra que el cine de terror puede dejar un valioso mensaje como otras pel√≠culas. Mi calificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es un 10/10."

I was glued to my bed watching this. Sure there are some plot holes and nitpicks I have with certain things that don‚Äôt make any sense and that came across as annoying, but that doesn‚Äôt outweigh what went into making this movie and how it impacted me as I watched it. There can be a lot of social and cultural commentary that this movie inspires us to have, in fact it‚Äôs a good addition to the conversation we‚Äôve been having for years. Beauty and fame vs authenticity and honesty. And it‚Äôs depressing since Demi Moore in this movie is already incredibly beautiful and still given crap for it towards the beginning! It made me frustrated but again, in kind of a good way and got me invested in this movie! By the end, it kind of feels like Carrie and the Thing combined, which was pretty neat. Well, there goes my bed time folks! That barely ever happens with me and horror anymore but I have to speak truthfully! What a work of art!"

How is this helpful?? They spend more time than necessary naked/boobs out, full frontal from Demi Moore who looks better than most people I know at 60 due to having a vast amount of wealth. Don't even get me started on the end part when excessive blood goes everywhere, like seriously as a fan of Eli Roth I was not impressed as it was just stupid. All in all I came out this film feeling depressed and unimpressed and how it managed to score so highly is beyond me. Never watching this again.

    "review": "*We discuss The Substance on Ep. 162 Here*. A modern The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Substance is a gnarly story about an aging star (literally, the movie begins with the creation of Elisabeth‚Äôs Sparkle‚Äôs (Demi Moore) Hollywood Boulevard star) and the deal she makes with a faceless company that sells a wonder drug known only as ‚ÄúThe Substance‚Äù. Once started, you ‚Äúbirth‚Äù a younger version of yourself (but it doesn‚Äôt look like you) who lives there life for a week at a time. Every seven days, you must switch back. Ignoring this detail leads to disastrous results. Coralie Fargeat shoots the film with the intent to make you squirm. For example, we hear and get a close-up of every dunk into cocktail sauce and mastication of Harvey‚Äôs (Dennis Quaid) lunchtime shrimp ‚Äî in this scene, he‚Äôs firing (without having the stones to really do so) Elisabeth for simply being too old. Harvey (I assume the name was intentional) endeavors to find the next hot thing. Elisabeth, after some gentle pushing from a young, handsome male nurse (Robin Greer), signs up for ‚ÄúThe Substance‚Äùsubscription. ‚ÄúSue,‚Äù (Margaret Qualley) her new form, is young and tight and exactly what Harvey ordered. If they kept a statistic for ‚ÄúMost Shots of Butts in a Movie,‚Äù this would have to be #1. Set to an powerful and catchy industrial and EDM score by Raffertie, Sue lives the life of adoration, success, and hotness seven days at a time, until that no longer is enough. Humans will abuse anything. The product of this abuse results in practical effect concoctions I haven‚Äôt seen in a contemporary movie in‚Ä¶ maybe ever. It doesn‚Äôt go from 0 to 100 right away, but a declension and decrepitude akin to stuff I‚Äôd expect in Society (77) or The Thing (91). The plot goes a little off the rails at the end, even if I understood the symbolism of Elisabeth‚Äôs actions. Fargeat deftly toes the line of ‚Äúa movie with a message‚Äù and a movie to entertain (like all movies should). This is a must-see, if you can handle it."

Well, technically I guess I was right! There's abuse of a substance alright! :D Kudos to Demi Moore for her wonderful portrayal of aging actress/fitness star Elizabeth Sparkle who thinks she's found a sort of fountain of youth after she is unceremoniously dumped by over-the-top network mogul \"Harvey,\" played with outrageous delight by Dennis Quaid (Life after Reagan???) I can only assume that this had to be the most rigorous, physically, mentally and emotionally demanding role of Moore's career. As Demi's younger \"alter ego,\" Margaret Qualley scores top marks for her performance as the beautiful, yet devious \"Sue.\" Director/screenwriter Coralie Fargeat's sci-fi thriller had me on the edge of my seat, squirming often during some highly disturbing scenes from suturing slit bodies to Dennis Quaid eating shrimp! (Disgusting! ü§Æ ) Unfortunately, Fargeat overcooked the ending! :( Still, it's a fun, wild ride and if you like horror/sci-fi/thrillers, you'll enjoy \"The Substance!\" :)"

    "review": "After watching The Substance, I was both captivated and unsettled by its audacious storytelling and intense visuals. Directed by Coralie Fargeat, this body-horror film delves into the extremes of beauty standards and the relentless pursuit of youth in Hollywood. Demi Moore delivers a fearless performance as Elisabeth Sparkle, a 50-year-old actress desperate to reclaim her fading stardom. Her portrayal is both raw and compelling, capturing the vulnerability and determination of a woman battling societal pressures. Margaret Qualley complements Moore's intensity, adding depth to the narrative with her nuanced acting. The film's visual style is striking, with Fargeat employing bold cinematography and unsettling imagery to create a visceral experience. The narrative is unapologetically direct, confronting the audience with the grotesque realities of cosmetic obsession. While some scenes are graphically intense, they serve to underscore the film's critique of the entertainment industry's fixation on youth and beauty. The Substance is not for the faint-hearted, but it offers a thought-provoking commentary on the lengths to which individuals will go to preserve their image. It's a daring piece of cinema that challenges conventional norms and leaves a lasting impression."

    "review": "**Review: *The Substance* ‚Äì 3.5/5 Stars** *The Substance* is a wild, body-horror ride that‚Äôs as slick as it is unsettling. Margaret Qualley is absolutely magnetic‚Äîyou can‚Äôt take your eyes off her, and honestly, why would you want to? The plot is fresh, bold, and taps into that horror-sci-fi sweet spot with some killer social commentary on Hollywood‚Äôs obsession with youth. The special effects? Insane. It nails that grotesque-yet-gorgeous vibe, and the aesthetic is pure perfection. Some of the camera work and editing are so sharp, they practically cut through the screen. It‚Äôs wildly entertaining, the kind of film that makes time evaporate. But while it delivers the thrills and a fresh take on body horror, it could‚Äôve used a bit more depth to really hit hard. Still, it‚Äôs easy to see why it‚Äôs hyped‚Äîif you love horror that‚Äôs daring and different, this is your jam. It‚Äôs freaky, it‚Äôs fun, and it sticks with you."

If you can stomach that, you'll survive \"The Substance\". \"The Substance\" kept my attention, laugh a few times, and am glad Demi Moore took on a risky role. I come from the \"Jazzercise\" era, so it was easy to identify with Elisabeth and Sue. Bring on the Accelerator."

I had to run and watch GI Jane to get that bad taste out of my mouth. Dennis Quaid is such a good actor, he made his sleezy character authentic. He should have turned this movie down. This should have been a 1980 USA Network up all night film."

    "review": "A movie that‚Äôs intended to be offensive, over the top and unapologetic for its portrayal of a very real inner struggle that many experience. It plays with heavy, personal topics and instead of hiding behind euphemisms, it intentionally shocks and disgusts the viewer by confronting these topics head-on in graphic, gruesome detail. This movie tells a story that‚Äôs been told before, but screams at the viewer to take it more seriously, and really question the underlying issues of having a perfect image, romanticizing youth above all else, and the shelf life of talent that the masses no longer find attractive. For all that this movie has to say, there feels like a focus issue at the end of the day. In criticizing the overt sexualization of young beauty, I left wondering if this movie is a critique or turning the volume up louder. At some point the nudity stops feeling intimate, and starts feeling like a way to keep the viewer engaged. Overall I did very much enjoy this movie, and what it had to say. It‚Äôs uncomfortable. It‚Äôs visually loud and intended to disgust. It is well done in many respects from visual effects to set design and anxiety-ridden editing. Unfortunately, the ending takes a powerful and visceral story, and doubles down on shock value and gore rather than the human struggle that it symbolizes . It feels as though the director handed the last 15 minutes off to a different director and didn‚Äôt bother to watch it. It‚Äôs an important movie that‚Äôs got a lot to say, but it should keep some of those things to itself."

I covered some aspects of its direction in a Korean YouTube video, but since it's not in English, I don‚Äôt think I can share it here. If you're interested, I recommend searching for it in Korean and focusing on the visuals. I hope more people can appreciate the beauty of this film. A hole is a circle through which other things can pass. In the film, eyes, cameras, shower hoses, and pipes serve as these holes. The movement of substances related to the hole forms lines.

    "review": "The Substance. I really regret not watching this sooner. After missing its theater run, I kept checking streaming services almost every weekend, hoping it would finally be available. I was even tempted to rent it on Apple or Google a few times. While waiting, I tried my best to avoid spoilers and memes, which was no easy task. Unfortunately, I still stumbled across a few grotesque memes and got some hints about the film‚Äôs intensity. But even with those glimpses, nothing could have truly prepared me for the experience of finally watching it. \"The Substance,\" directed by Coralie Fargeat, is a bold and visceral exploration of vanity, obsession, and societal pressures, delivered in a way that is both captivating and deeply unsettling. Balancing horror with sharp social commentary, the film evokes a complex mix of fascination and discomfort, leaving audiences caught in a love-hate relationship that lingers, alongside with the search for the meaning in the film. Themes such as body dysmorphia, substance abuse alongside others are all littered throughout the screenplay make it enigmatic and engaging to watch. The film felt like a blend of David Cronenberg‚Äôs body horror and Michael Crichton‚Äôs sci-fi intrigue, with the practical effects reminiscent of Alien. The first half delivers a gripping, powerful story, pulling the audience into its unsettling world. Visually striking, the film boasts meticulous set designs akin to Stanley Kubrick, top-tier sound and editing, and an Academy-worthy performance by Demi Moore. It seamlessly shifts between the sleazy underbelly of Hollywood show business and a nightmarish, hallucinatory descent into dark, surreal passages beyond the studio walls. I‚Äôve seen my fair share of disturbing films, but this one pushed me to an entirely new level. If you struggle with anxiety, consider yourself warned‚Äîthis is not an easy watch. That said, I have to applaud the cast for their fearless performances and the director and crew for crafting such an intense, immersive experience. The film felt like a chaotic symphony of psychological torment, reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange, all while I sat frozen in my comfortable living room. The film‚Äôs visuals are absolutely stunning, with striking color contrasts that make every frame feel meticulously crafted. These contrasts, seamlessly woven throughout the scenes, elevate the film‚Äôs aesthetic, balancing artistry with unease. The cinematography amplifies this discomfort, using clever framing and movement that keep you on edge, while the haunting score sustains an atmosphere of dread from start to finish. Each scene is expertly constructed, with impressive attention to detail, ensuring the film remains immersive and visually captivating. The style is exceptionally aesthetic, operating more like a carefully curated paint palette than a traditional work of art‚Äîvibrant and pleasing yet strangely clinical, devoid of soulful substance, which adds layers to the experience. In this regard, the film is both impressive and notable. The cinematography and editing immediately place it on a level with the works of the great directors and auteurs, including those no longer with us, leaving a lasting imprint on the viewer. The final act is an entirely different beast, taking a wild, unexpected turn that pushes the film into even more unhinged territory. Without spoiling anything, it goes far beyond what I anticipated. While I can see some viewers criticizing this descent into madness, I personally appreciated it‚Äîit‚Äôs what elevates the film to potential cult status. My only critique is the runtime; parts of the final act could have been trimmed without losing impact. That said, the full spiral was necessary to deliver the shock value that makes the film so unforgettable. In the end, The Substance is an unforgettable cinematic experience‚Äîone that lingers long after the film is finished. I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep after watching it‚Äînot out of fear, but because its themes, visuals, and message kept replaying in my mind. Coralie Fargeat has crafted a film that is as thought-provoking as it is unsettling, seamlessly blending body horror, sci-fi, and sharp social commentary into something truly unique. While its descent into madness may not be for everyone, I found it to be a bold, thrilling choice that cements its potential cult status. Despite minor pacing issues, the film‚Äôs stunning visuals, gripping performances, and unrelenting atmosphere make it a must-watch for those who can handle its intensity. I only wish I had seen it sooner. 9/10"

    "review": "What started off as a promising film, reminiscent of the plot of Death Becomes Her, fell apart. It nosedived spectacularly into a plotless string of increasingly more implausible scenes. I can only imagine the writers quit half way through and someone‚Äôs children were given access to the special effects. This ushers in 30 minutes of madness that results in my favourite part: the end. Save yourself the time and stop watching halfway through and imagine the rest."

    "review": "The fact that this movie has such high ratings on both rotten tomato and metacritic truly makes me have no trust in those ratings for any movie. This movie was a comical disaster to say the least. The two female roles were played well, Ill give it that. Interesting concept overall. Last 20 minutes of the movie they either didn't care or let some 6 year old boy write it. It turns into a mixture of old school alien horror with \"Carrie\" the movie type blood. 3.5 out of 5 is generous until the final 20 minutes then its laughably brought to a 0 for me. Dont waste your time. Dont be fooled by what i can only assume are paid or fake reviews"

    "review": "The worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The beginning has a lot of unnecessary nudity, but it was still interesting and maybe a little different from what I had seen before. However, from the middle to the end, it became horrible, impossible to watch too many gore scenes and crazy stuff. Anyone who liked this movie must be insane. The actresses are great, but the director is terrible, and the plot is awful. I lost 2 hours of my life and my sanity. THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER WATCHED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE (AND I WATCHED SHARKNADO)."

    "review": "I really enjoyed about 85% of The Substance. It was heartbreaking to watch Elisabeth, still absolutely stunningly beautiful, look at herself and see ugliness. It was infuriating to watch Harvey treat her so dismissively in his gluttonous, slimy way. Demi Moore was fantastic, authentic, sincere, relatable. Dennis Quaid was perfectly despicable. He really gave off Coriolanus Snow vibes from The Hunger Games. And Margaret Qualley was wonderful as the perfect beauty queen everyone wants to see while also harboring a dark, sadistic side. There is a bit of nudity, but for once it wasn't gratuitous. There was a purpose. They could have scaled some of it back, but it explicitly showed the real 50 year old body of Elisabeth versus the nearly unrealistically flawless body by comparison in Sue. The horror movie aspect was truly disturbing. From the creation of Sue to the deterioration of Elisabeth. It was realistically detailed from both up close and from a distance intentionally making the audience squirm to witness the unimaginable lengths one would go through to maintain beauty and admiration. And then Sue tried to use The Substance. And the monster, well, that's when they lost me. While the whole movie is based around in implausible premise, they went about it in a hyper realistic way. Except the monster at the end. It had all the realism of a monster blob out of a bad 80s horror movie. Or an 80s comedy even. I was reminded of Pizza the Hut from Space Balls or the monster that the bully brother was turned into in Weird Science. It turned an otherwise entertaining modern horror movie into a sad joke. It wasn't scary. It wasn't disgusting. It was disappointing and really ruined the entire end of the potentially more-than-decent movie. I originally gave The Substance a 3.5 Star Prediction. For about 85% of the movie, it was at about a 4. The last bit completely wiped all that out resulting in another disappointing 2.5 Stars for another Oscar Nominated Best Picture movie."
