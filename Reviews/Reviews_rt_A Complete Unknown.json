    "review": "Biopics are a dime a dozen. Dylan is not. Thankfully, A Complete Unknown knows the difference. Rather than tracing Bob Dylan‚Äôs life like a Wikipedia entry in chronological order, James Mangold opts for something slipperier, more poetic. This isn‚Äôt about where Dylan was born or how many albums he sold‚Äîit‚Äôs about becoming Dylan. The myth, the mask, the movement. And in that regard, it succeeds. Timoth√©e Chalamet steps into the role with a kind of quiet defiance. He doesn‚Äôt do an impression‚Äîhe interprets. His Dylan is all twitchy intelligence and shapeshifting charm, someone both fully present and already slipping through your fingers. He sings too‚Äîand surprisingly, it works. The musical moments aren‚Äôt just performance‚Äîthey‚Äôre revelation. Mangold, no stranger to musical legends after Walk the Line, brings a sense of grounded energy to the film. But this time he leans into abstraction. Scenes fold in on themselves. The narrative drifts like smoke from a lit cigarette. It‚Äôs not incoherent‚Äîit‚Äôs intentional. The film seems to ask: ‚ÄúWho is Dylan, really?‚Äù and then dares to answer, ‚ÄúWhoever he needed to be.‚Äù Visually, the film is stunning. Sepia-drenched and snow-dusted, with cinematography that feels intimate but never romanticized. The supporting cast‚Äîparticularly Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez and Elle Fanning as a fictionalized muse‚Äîgive the story texture without hijacking the focus. Some audiences might want a clearer arc or a juicier scandal. They won‚Äôt find it here. What they‚Äôll get instead is a meditation on reinvention, fame, and the cost of staying unpredictable in a world desperate to define you. A Complete Unknown doesn‚Äôt play all the hits. It doesn‚Äôt need to. Like Dylan himself, it‚Äôs more interested in transformation than nostalgia."

    "review": "‚ÄúA Complete Unknown‚Äù may just be the best musical biopic in years‚Äîraw, immersive, and utterly magnetic. Timoth√©e Chalamet delivers a richly layered performance as Bob Dylan, capturing both the charisma and the inner turmoil of an artist on the brink of legend. Critics weren‚Äôt wrong to praise him‚Äîhe sings over 40 songs live, and his renditions of Song to Woody, Masters of War, and The Times They Are A-Changin‚Äô are elevated by hauntingly powerful direction. Monica Barbaro is a standout revelation as Joan Baez‚Äîsoulful, sharp, and deeply moving. The film zeroes in on a pivotal chapter in Dylan‚Äôs rise to fame, steering clear of tired tropes like drug spirals or forced redemption. Instead, it explores the weight of expectations and the relentless pursuit of artistic freedom. It‚Äôs rich in music, beautifully contextualized, and avoids clich√© at every turn."

    "review": "This film, adapted from Elijah Wald's book Dylan Goes Electric!, follows Bob Dylan‚Äôs rise from \"a complete unknown\" to a folk legend. It explores his tumultuous romantic relationships and friendships with both established and emerging artists of the time‚Äîshowing how these bonds shaped his career and personal growth. Tracing his transformation into the voice of a generation, it illustrates how he revolutionized music, sparked societal change through his lyrics, and ultimately became one of the most iconic and influential singer-songwriters in history. Overall, due to it's authentic and moving vocal performances (particularly the duets), Chalamet's transformative, Tour de force, and award nominated portrayal of Dylan (his voice and mannerisms are spot-on, and hot take, he's a better singer than Dylan himself ), the impressive supporting performances by Barbaro, whose captivating and genuine award nominated portrayal of Baez (featuring a fantastic voice), and Fanning, who delivers a vulnerable and subtle, but sadly snubbed performance as Russo (their undeniable chemistry shines, with both actresses complementing Chalamet beautifully) , and its poignant message on staying true to yourself in the face of fame, expectations, and change. this movie is very good, and even though I don't love Dylan‚Äôs voice or style ( I acknowledge his immense impact and songwriting talent), and the abundance of celebrity cameos at times overshadow Dylan, making him feel like a side character in his own story‚Äî, I still enjoyed my time with this feature, it feels like watching a live concert interwoven with brief glimpses behind the scenes of the artist's mysterious and unconventional life, and while its a very different (more compelling) take on the traditional biopic, I believe Dylan fans will love it and for haters like myself,: if I ended up enjoying it this much, I urge you to give it a chance‚Äîit might just surprise you, the way it did me."

    "review": "86%. 4/25/25. Basically a story about Bob Dylan's rise to stardom. He travels with nothing but his guitar from Minnesota to New York to meet his idol Woody Gunthrie in a care unit. There he plays a song for Woody and Woody's manager who's also a musician, Pete Seeger. Pete starts to take him out to perform around the city and he blows up. He plays at Monterey Folk Festival in 1963, where Johnny Cash also played. Fun to see Bob write some of his songs. They don't paint him in the best light tho, making him to look like a dick. He also really wants to play his new music which isn't folk music like his older stuff. Entertaining film. 3/5 rewatch"

Beim Schauen des Films glaubt man sogar, dass er die Songs nicht selber geschrieben hat, sondern von Kolleginnen gecovert hat. Der Film ist nicht schlecht gedreht und vom Schauspiel auch gut. Die Story ist aber sehr mau und langweilig. Was den Film rettet, sind die Songs und die Auftritte. F√ºr mich bis jetzt das schlechteste Biopic. 6/10"

Ditto Edward Norton as Pete Seeger. All the actors really learned and sang and played the songs, in addition to giving their performances their all. The scene where Dylan first sings The Times They Are A Changing at Newport Folk Festival and stuns the crowd, and then the scene where he goes electric and the crowd is furious, are both great. Also the scene where Dylan and Baez sing It Ain't Me Babe to each other and together, and the chemistry between them is electric. I truly felt transported to the time and place, and Dylan's character was developed but also still maintained some of its real life mystery and aloofness. The type of Hollywood film I love."

I Found Bob to be quite dislikeable. the strongest takeaway was how frustrating it is for an artist who has had one or some very popular songs feels trapped by audiences who expect to hear them and not being interested in newer work. Also Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan's relationship was a surprise to learn about. I learned more about Joan Baez. and I did a lot of reading afterwards, in terms of what the movie chose to leave out, about politics."

The pacing of the movie was great; it was over 2 hours but never felt long, never dragged, and there are no scenes that I could think of removing or shortening. If you like any mid-20th-century folk music (including blues & country), I think you'll appreciate the songtrack. I wanted to dislike Elle Fanning's performance, because she so often looked like she was in distress, but in retrospect it was true to her character."

Throw stones at me if you must, but I had wished there was a reference to the Clancy Brothers in there, because I am Irish and I know Dylan loved the Clancy Brothers and emulated them and followed them around.

What begins as an innocent journey for folk stardom becomes a multi-layered portrait of an artist who cared more for his art than for his fans or the people who helped to get him where he got to in the annals of rock n roll history.

The themes are not comprehensively addressed, creating a series of unanswered questions and the feeling of having witnessed the autobiographical story of \"a complete unknown.\" Mangold's direction results in a refined and beautiful simulation, skillfully scored, and an interpretive prowess that only Thimoth√©e Chalamet and a couple of other actors could match. \"Without a doubt, A Complete Unknown is the most elaborate representation of Bob Dylan's work and legacy.\""

    "review": "First of all, James Mangold is a masterful director, but the kind where you never see his fingerprints, no flashy stuff, not a Stanley Kubrick. From the opening where Bob is dropped off in Greenwich Village you can tell this is a labor of love, the sets, the wardrobe, the lighting are immaculate (look at all the trash in the streets). For those of you who are only plot driven and everything turns into a who done it, this is not for you. This is like Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, it's character driven, it's a character study. Compared to most other bio-pics the amount of music in this is astounding, so if you don't like the tunes or the singers, you're in trouble. I was thoroughly impressed my Monica Barbaro's singing, she previously was an unknown to me. Ed Norton, as always nails it. Elle Fanning's character is pathetic, but she's supposed to be (a difficult character to write and play). Boyd Holbrook captures the wild, anarchist side of Johhny Cash perfectly, the car crashing is hysterical. The fact that Bob rides a Triumph recklessly and thinks he's bullet proof is typical and as we know later in his life that the bike takes him out. A lot of people don't like how self serving Bob is, but he's 19 years old, on his own, a long way from home, his vanity, confidence, ego and sunglasses and hustle are his protection. Timothee captures the aloofness just right for a subject who has always been guarded his whole life. Also Timothee turned into a guitar player for this, watch his right hand. If you try to judge Dylan by your life's experiences, you're going to' fail, unless the Beatles were trying to emulate you (Hide Your Love Away) The dialogue overall is very realistic and occasionally sparkling. Lastly, the pacing of this movie is leisurely, which is rare these days, but if you like hanging out with new friends, this hits the spot."

    "review": "I will firmly admit that while I really like Bob Dylan‚Äòs music I‚Äôve always known that it seems to me that he was always a pretentious prick, especially when he was young and famous. I completely understand that because if I had been that talented and famous in my early 20s, I would‚Äôve been impossible to be around so I‚Äôm letting that go. But knowing those flaws Didn‚Äôt really make me wanna watch this movie. But it came on Hulu for free and I said what the heck, I have nothing to lose. I was really impressed. This singles out the point of time in Bob Dylan‚Äôs life that is the most interesting and the most creative more or less. And it went about telling that story with patience And with a methodical interesting well developed plot. The music was really good, it didn‚Äôt really give you any songs that you didn‚Äôt already know which it should have. There are some early Bob Dylan gems that people never hear but are really really good. If you want to get some of that, watch, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look back‚Äù the documentary and he plays some of those really nice songs in that. So overall, this is a very good movie and it is well informative and tells you things that you wouldn‚Äôt know unless you read a biography about Bob Dylan. It shows that he was a pretentious prick sure, but like I said, totally understandable, they‚Äôre really hadn‚Äôt been anyone like him before he came along. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it five stars is because there is a much better film about folk music and it‚Äôs origins it‚Äôs called - Inside Llewyn Davis- In fact it‚Äôs so much better of a film altogether that while I‚Äôm watching this Bob Dylan movie all I could think about was that film by the Cohen Brothers. And in a way the Cohen brothers film kind of ruined this movie because it‚Äôs already given you that great New York late 1950s very early 1960s beatmusic kind of US being on top of the world feeling and we were at the cutting edge or one of the countries at the cutting edge of culture, etc., at that time."

Timmy did a beautiful job and I hope he gets all the recognition he very much deserves for this masterpiece because his dedication to this role absolutely shows. The very ending of this movie is also quite significant because as he says goodbye to his hero Woodie Guthrie as the song sings in the background \"so long, good to know ya\", I believe it is a representation of how he is saying goodbye to all his previous beliefs and thoughts of the music and how it should be played. It might also be a representation of him saying goodbye to his past self and the past spark he was trying to catch and rather creating his own spark. I just finished writing a review for Gladiator 2 and am realizing that, while they are in extremely different situations, the underlying message is sort of the same in the sense that you should always stay true to who you are and what you believe in and to not let anyone ever tell you who or what you are, no matter how powerful or how much more they think they know. Defying norms could pave the pathway for others, even with no support behind you, you can create your own support. Sing your songs loud, make your voice heard, and dirty some carpets along the way."

It is rare to see an actor perform their own singing in musical biopics, and Chalamet's portrayal is nothing short of remarkable. I also enjoyed the performances of other actors such as Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez and Edward Norton. The movie portrays the journey of an unknown folk artist who rises to become one of the greatest singer and songwriters of all time. It also depicts Bob Dylan's personal and love life. Bob Dylan is one of the few iconic musicians whose legacy will endure long after his passing (though he is still very much alive). His music transcends generations and remains timeless. While Bob Dylan isn't exactly my generation (though I know a few of his songs), I thoroughly enjoyed this film and the opportunity to learn more about his life and his music."

Wondering how this scrawny, Victorian-esque looking man is going to pull off a Bob Dylan impersonation. Left wondering how the hell Timothee Chalamet didn't win an Oscar. The dedication to fitting the part of Dylan is clearly visible in Chalamet's acting, and executed rather aesthetically. From his nasty, grown-out finger nails, to his Midwestern, nasally accent, his portrayal of Dylan was nothing short of impressive. Spending five years preparing for a role is dedication from an actor at its finest. His respect and observation to the material paid off beautifully. I am afraid I have previously underestimated Timothee Chalamet and now hold a new appreciation for his driven devotion."

The choice of the cast was good where the chemistry was smooth amongst them, while also presenting the story of various relationships. The over 2 hour film was not boring, but rather interesting because it shows a teenager exploring the complete unknown, which resonates with film title and the lyric to Dylan's well known song. Edward Norton's portrayal as Pete Seeger was refreshing as I have seen him in villainous roles from other movies. However, he showed the mentorship and supporting aspects throughout Dylan's times. Chalamet was determined in taking this role, which I commend for because he wasn't overboard with having to portray Dylan 100%, but sufficient for us to know he is Bob Dylan. Monica Barbaro and Elle Fanning did a good job because Fanning's role was subliminal with how although she loved Bob Dylan, she also was aware she could not be with him. Barbaro as Joan Baez showed a contrast in that her character was full of confidence, but also didn't forget the womanly traits in the voice. Music was well executed, with us having more of a nostalgia recognition of folk music popularity during 1960s."

I keep reading that the Sylvie character (Suze Rotolo in real life) was one of the great loves of Bob Dylan's life, but according to the movie he didn't care much for her at all, or anyone really but himself. Not Sylvie, not Joan Baez, not Pete Seeger (who basically kick-started his career). I didn't get a sense love or passion in either of the romantic relationships portrayed in the film, nor did I get a sense of friendship with any of the other characters. Perhaps the only person Bob cared about besides himself was Woody Guthrie, who he seemed to idolise and wrote a song for. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the film portrayed Bob Dylan as a pretty callous jerk who was remote and didn't show love or friendship to anyone. Was that what he was actually like? It makes for a fairly uninteresting character. One thing I think the film showed very successfully was that Bob Dylan was a great writer. He can't sing very well, but his lyrics and melodies are legendary for a reason."

Dylan fans will no doubt experience mixed emotions as the film dutifully ticks historical boxes while reducing its major players to two-dimensional stand-ins. All the same, diehards and newcomers alike will find much to appreciate in its embodied performances and beautifully curated soundtrack."

I recommend watching it at home with closed caption because we could not understand 95% of anything Bob said... yes, it might have been true to how mumbly Bob Dylan often truly sounds, but it did not help the story line to not be able to understand the main character's words. The movie showed a lot of people reacting to things he said, and my movie partner would look at each other and shrug, but we both gave up trying to decipher Bob's words."

Timoth√©e Chalamet‚Äôs portrayal, having learned harmonica, guitar and The Voice, gives a spellbinding portrayal of a musical genius and so deserving of awards. The Joan Baez actress Monica Barbaro was less able to meet that challenge but Edward Norton‚Äôs Pete Seeger was a revelation - portrayed as a sweet kind environmentally-concerned folky mentor. The street and indoor scenes seemed to be very authentic of the time with a spotlight on the tension of the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was good to see how Dylan blew a hole in the traditionalist view of the time - that folk music was a white man with an acoustic guitar The festivals made me want to seek out original footage and hear more about Dylan. A top eye-opening movie for music fans. Even if you‚Äôre not a Bob Dylan acolyte, you might lean that way after this movie."

I also liked the choice of the other actors. I didn't feel distant, I felt that they were all there in the story. Timothee prepared so well for the role. Five years is a long time. You can tell that he really wanted this, he wanted to do a good job. I confess that I thought he was a bit shallow. You can judge me. I couldn't see beyond him. In this film, I was able to see beyond him. I saw him differently. It may have been his long preparation, and if it was, it was good that it worked out and we have this great performance from his career to remember. To carry a film on his shoulders, he could not have achieved such greatness, but he did. We can see his dedication when, just by watching and listening, we know that he was really playing the instruments and singing. This is the role of Timothee that I liked the most. I liked it because he simply showed that he can do more as an actor, and I'm very happy to be wrong about him. He deserved all the nominations and all the awards he received."

The actors do a good job in general and the film looks the part, but it spends too much time on Dylan being a rebel and not enough on his actual music. His creative process, what set him apart, is barely touched on. Instead, the film keeps reminding us that he didn't like to be put in a box, which is true, but not enough to make the story engaging. I'm not much into folk music, but a great biopic should pull you in no matter what. This one didn't. It just felt like any other movie that you watch on a Sunday afternoon on TV."

    "review": "Rather than focusing on a specific event or attempting to summarize Bob Dylan‚Äôs entire life, the film paints a portrait of him during his rise to fame, centering around the infamous ‚Äúelectric guitar performance‚Äù at the Newport Folk Festival. It doesn‚Äôt follow a conventional narrative structure, as we meet Dylan at a point where he has already made a major decision, leaving much of his past a mystery. While the film does present an arc for its protagonist, it remains relatively flat; not necessarily a flaw, but a choice that may not resonate with all viewers. The narrative isn‚Äôt the film‚Äôs strongest aspect, but that‚Äôs not where its focus lies. Where the film truly excels is in its production design, which effectively immerses us in the early 1960s American folk music scene. The costume design further enhances the authenticity of the era. The performances are outstanding, with Timoth√©e Chalamet stealing the show as Bob Dylan, once again showcasing his versatility; not only as an actor but also as a singer, following his work in Wonka last year. Monica Barbaro also delivers a standout performance as Joan Baez. From a technical standpoint, the cinematography and editing are near flawless, perfectly complementing the film‚Äôs tone. The use of sound and music is particularly effective, drawing us deeper into Dylan‚Äôs world through beautifully rendered performances. While this film may not be for everyone, there‚Äôs plenty to appreciate for music lovers, especially fans of Bob Dylan. I‚Äôd recommend it, with the caveat that if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with what you‚Äôre getting into, you might find little to latch onto. Nonetheless, it‚Äôs a finely crafted film."

So let's break it down: Story ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ When the story is based around one of the greatest musicians of all time, you get a big advantage already. I wasn't completely familiar with Dylan's life, so watching it unfold on the big screen was a great insight. Masterfully written, at the right pace, this film hits all the right notes. Literally. Acting ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Timoth√©e Chalamet blew my mind with this one. Not only has he got Dylan's looks, but he perfected the sounds and mannerisms. To sing live for some was bold, and worked so well I couldn't tell the difference between him and the real thing. True dedication from Chalamet in this one. Edward Norton played Pete Seeger, fantastic as always. Also Monica Barbaro, as Joan Baez; and Elle Fanning, as Sylvie Russo. Both played brilliant roles. Cinematography ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ Phedon Papamichael did a really great job, giving true justice and making it more than worthy of the big screen. Some really interesting and long shots during the performances. Sound ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ What's a film about music without great sound? The songs were obviously classics, and came across well. The chaos of the final performance was brought across through the sound. The fact that I couldn't understand half of what Chalamet was saying was, in this case only, the signification of an accurate job well done, too. Design ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ It felt as if I was transported back to the time. Those details on the streets added to the immersive setting. Costumes were brilliantly made, also. Was it fun? Absolutely! Up there as the best biopic I've seen yet, a big thumbs up to James Mangold. Overall ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ"

It gives everything such a natural, authentic feel, especially with so many musical numbers. Most movies about musicians jar you when they break into song because of the overdubbed voices and sound mix changes. Instead, it felt like you were right there with the musicians as they began to sing. This ensemble cast of singers is just ridiculously talented. And Timoth√©e Chalamet gives an uncanny delivery of Bob Dylan. The two female leads were also fantastic, capturing the swirl of energies surrounding Dylan. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that we really only see them in their relationship to him, which makes sense for a biopic that's about him, but it does feel a bit outmoded to relegate women to that role as a storytelling device. Overall, I wasn‚Äôt in love with the movie as a whole. It‚Äôs a fine, pretty standard musician biopic. They could‚Äôve given more historical context, especially to explain the importance of the Newport Folk Festival, which might go over the heads of viewers who weren't alive at the time. Also, I would‚Äôve liked a deeper dive into Dylan‚Äôs motivations -- what inspired his songs, who he really was, and that tension within him. I get that he‚Äôs meant to be enigmatic, but it would‚Äôve been nice to see more of that inner conflict and reasoning for his artistic choices. Instead, it‚Äôs mostly the \"what\" but not much of the \"why\". Maybe that's as Bob would have wanted it."

    "review": "Musical biopics have a mixed reputation for a variety of reasons. Yes, they‚Äôre often at the forefront when it comes to awards season, but their actual content can often feel stale, stretched out or just plain fabricated. A Complete Unknown wisely sticks to a relatively short period in Dylan‚Äôs lengthy and still ongoing career, rather than trying to speedrun through the entire thing, right up to present day. The problem is, in the time it does cover, it doesn‚Äôt really give us much of an insight into Dylan as a person or as an artist. He‚Äôs obviously incredibly gifted, and whether you‚Äôre a fan of his music or not its hard to deny that his lyrics don‚Äôt have a certain poetry and emotional resonance. But there‚Äôs no real analysis of where the words come from. Not from some inner torment, longing or desire to express what can only be communicated through music. He just sits down with his guitar and bam, hit song! This might be how things really happened, but it doesn‚Äôt make for good cinema. Dylan‚Äôs personal life also doesn‚Äôt get much of a look in, and his attitude rarely rises above moody teenager being told to tidy his room status. It‚Äôs sad that, in a film ostensibly about Dylan, that he manages to be one of its least interesting characters, and the movie‚Äôs insistence on showcasing as many of his tunes as possible, some played in their entirety, means there‚Äôs very little space left for human drama. I‚Äôm sure some will argue that the songs themselves are the drama, but most are simply played on stage or in a studio, with minimal conflict. The controversy of a folk singer using an electric guitar pops up over halfway through the film and doesn‚Äôt cause the kind of furore you‚Äôd imagine it would. I will admit, Timothee Chalamet, a talented actor who might be on the cusp of overexposure at this point, does a fantastic job in the lead role, perfectly aping Dylan‚Äôs mannerisms and contrarian attitude. I also liked how the film doesn‚Äôt try to gloss over the fact that, while he might be unanimously praised as a songwriter, he has far from the best singing voice. It‚Äôs clearly been made with love for its subject matter, perhaps too much love, and its attempts not to upset a cultural icon, or their fanbase, has resulted in a biopic that‚Äôs afraid to stray too far from the beaten path. I‚Äôm not a Bob Dylan fan by any means, but even I know that he deserved something much more complex than this."

Covering his early 60s meeting with folk icon Wood Guthrie through to his controversial 'goes electric' set at the Newport Festival we get a well crafted story through the zeitgeist period of his creative powers. Relationships are covered but we don't get to discover much beyond what we already know. Timothee Chalamet gives a decent performance without resorting to impersonation or parody and he's ably supported by an excellent cast. I still feel there was more to be had here and it's maybe not as definitive as it could (or should) be but it has restored my faith in music biopics somewhat after a series of lacklustre recent efforts."

Que √≥timo.

Eu disse que n√£o aguentava mais ele e seus olhinhos ca√≠dos em filmes gigantes por a√≠, mas volto atr√°s, encarnou o personagem com tanto capricho, com camadas, com respeito e honrou Dylan, afinal, foram 5 anos se preparando e afinando o viol√£o.

I‚Äôve always been a Dylan fan, but in the last year or two, I‚Äôve become borderline fanatic I found myself moved to tears several times listening to Chalamet (who did his own singing & playing!) interpret Dylan. Also, as a man of a certain age, the movie took me back to my childhood in the 60‚Äôs when I was just a kid expanding his musical universe, and his view of the world outside of my Brooklyn neighborhood.

    "review": "\"A Complete Unknown\" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into the transformative early years of Bob Dylan, capturing the essence of an artist on the brink of revolutionizing the music scene. Directed by James Mangold, the film offers an immersive journey through the pivotal moments that shaped Dylan's illustrious career. Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Dylan is nothing short of mesmerizing. He embodies the enigmatic aura of the young troubadour, delivering performances that are both authentic and electrifying. Chalamet's commitment to the role is evident, as he performs Dylan's songs live, capturing the raw energy and emotion that defined the era. His rendition of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" at the Newport Folk Festival is particularly noteworthy, encapsulating the tension and excitement of that historic moment. The supporting cast enhances the film's depth and authenticity. Monica Barbaro delivers a captivating performance as Joan Baez, portraying the intricate dynamics of their relationship with grace and nuance. Elle Fanning shines as Sylvie Russo, a character inspired by Suze Rotolo, bringing warmth and complexity to the narrative. Edward Norton, in a subtle yet impactful role as Pete Seeger, adds gravitas to the storyline, highlighting the generational tensions within the folk music community. Mangold's direction is both respectful and innovative, weaving Dylan's music seamlessly into the narrative fabric of the film. The decision to let full performances drive the story allows the audience to connect deeply with the music and the moments it represents. The cinematography captures the gritty vibrancy of 1960s New York, transporting viewers to a time of cultural upheaval and artistic fervor. \"A Complete Unknown\" stands out not just as a biopic but as a profound exploration of an artist's journey through a transformative period. It offers a fresh perspective on Dylan's early years, shedding light on the personal and professional challenges he faced. The film's commitment to authenticity, combined with stellar performances and masterful direction, makes it a must-watch for both fans of Dylan and cinema enthusiasts alike. In essence, \"A Complete Unknown\" is a triumph, capturing the spirit of a musical legend with passion and precision. It's a film that resonates long after the credits roll, prompting reflection on the enduring impact of an artist who dared to defy conventions."

Timothy what's his face, shambles uneasily through a disingenuous and tiresome performance, unsure who to portray Dylan as. Dylan maybe? There are times he wears the face of some deranged serial killer, intently stalking his next victim from the side of a folk concert stage. It struggles to find a relatable core for the wavering script, or a theme beyond some surface level notion of \"the artist\". Instead of capturing a genius in his time, we cage a wobbly imitator of a man who never existed, and sigh at the tired routine. Your time is better spent with the Scorsese documentary."

    "rating": "1/5",
    "review": "I actually really wanted to love this... I got really into Bob Dylan when I was 13-ish, an offshoot from my obsession with the Beatles, of course I had to get into the guy who gave them weed and was in George's supergroup, a no brainer! Because of that I maybe know a little bit more about Dylan than the average bear (and I would say that I definitely know more about New York in the 60s than the average audience) and I'm trying very hard to not let that influence my overall feelings on this film since I recognize many people (the majority of the audience) are not as familiar with the setting or the subject as I am. Despite this huge disclaimer I'm really only focused on the acting and the script, where my problems only slightly intersect with my own preexisting knowledge. This movie felt, for lack of a better expression, completely hollow to me. I get that it's just about the period between 1961 and 1966 in Bob Dylan's life but it somehow made that period incredibly uninteresting, as it did with Dylan himself. Throughout the entire movie I was asking myself \"what is the point?\" and coming up with nothing. If the film had been framed as an artsy examination of part of Bob Dylan's life maybe this would have played out fine but as a biopic that should seemingly reach the masses the point was missed, for me, at least. I also... did not like Timothee Chalamet as Bob Dylan at all. Until the movie hit 1965 I actually only saw Timothee Chalamet on the screen and not Bob Dylan or even a caricature of him and then in the last third of the movie sometimes Timothee was selling Bob but really only when he had the sunglasses on (he's also like... way too tall to be Bob like they should have hired giants to play everyone else i kept getting pulled out of the fantasy once I was able to buy into it at all by how much taller than everyone else Bob was in the film). I think that any actor worth anything should be able to do an impersonation and that's all I'm seeing here. I have liked Timothee in other things and think that he's generally a good actor but I'm not seeing greatness in this portrayal, just a distraction that takes me out of the movie (although the lack of direction in the movie maybe made my inability to lock in a good thing?) For a good biopic to work the actor really needs to disappear into the character (particularly true when the biopic is about a pop culture figure who is already well documented audiovisually) and Timothee is unable to do that, partially, I'm sure, because of his large fan base and popularity but intrinsically there was something just holding him back from becoming Bob Dylan and holding me back from believing that he was Bob Dylan. There was also a major failure of Timothee to show Dylan as both an arrogant prick AND a charming genius, there were no moments in the film where I saw his Dylan as a genius, but many where I saw him as a complete asshole who people really should not want to hang around (conversely in Pennebaker's Don't Look Back, the real Bob Dylan comes off equally strong as a genius and a prick, showing why people might actually want to be around him). I also felt as though the movie was treating the audience like dumb dumb little idiot babies and trying to explain every finite little thing and person until suddenly it wasn't doing that and random people were appearing without any explanation as to who they were or why the audience should care. This is also connected to the fact that I still believe there was no plot in the film and it exists merely to show an insolent brat wanting to play electric guitar at the Newport Folk Fest. The only thing I really liked (maybe even loved) about this movie was Edward Norton's Pete Seeger. If Timothee Chalamet as Bob Dylan is a lesson in how NOT to do biopic acting, Edward Norton as Pete Seeger is a lesson on how TO do biopic acting. He disappeared into the role and had me firmly believing he was Pete Seeger every time he was on screen. I want to see a full length Seeger biopic starring Ed Norton STAT. This film would have been better (and maybe had an actual point) if it had been more focused on him than Bob Dylan."

    "review": "This biographical musical drama, directed by James Mangold and based on the book 'Dylan Goes Electric!' by Elijah Wald, takes audiences back to 1961, following a 19-year-old Bob Dylan as he arrives in New York City with his guitar and forges relationships with musical icons on his meteoric rise, culminating in a groundbreaking performance that reverberates around the world. Even if you are not familiar with the artist, the film is an engaging and well-crafted character study with a meticulous and powerhouse performance by Timoth√©e Chalamet who proves once again that he is one of the most talented actors of his generation. His live singing is fantastic, showcasing the dedication behind his preparation. Edward Norton and Monica Barbaro also shine, embodying their roles with striking accuracy. The immersive period setting transports viewers straight into the 1960s, while the unmatched soundtrack makes this film a mesmerizing experience for both music and cinema lovers."

    "review": "Its focus is on the music that Bob Dylan created during his most iconic run, up to his infamous performance at the Newport Folk Festival, and the environment that he created it in. In that regard, it's pretty straight forward, not concerning itself with diving deeper into any one aspect. Instead, it grazes over everything: the music, the man, his relationships, the period - which on paper may make the movie appear too shallow to be enjoyed. But the combination of charismatic actors fully committed to their roles, tons of music from this era of Bob Dylan, and a recreation of the 1960s that has all the right vibes, elevates this movie from something forgettable to something truly crowd pleasing. In the end, the audience in my theatre clapped. That should tell you a lot."

The original vagabond, the traveller of a world that looks tired and torn - his words a poetry that touches on the beauty and mystery of the simple and the grand, all whilst seemingly rejecting any ego about it, staying true to himself however ugly it gets.

It's an understated, subtle film that, with just a few deft brushstrokes, highlights the genius of its subject and captures the feeling of the era. It gave me a fresh perspective and renewed my appreciation for the talents of the time. They did justice to that pivotal moment in music history and to the inimitable Bob Dylan, which is no small feat! I felt like I was right THERE with all of these legends.

It‚Äôs an engaging film but the sound quality is not always good so you cannot hear all the dialogue clearly. Why this still happens with movies is a mystery. Making a film like this involves certain choices- like how much to concentrate on the person or their work, how much dramatic license to gloss on real life events and how much to go for verisimilitude.

Timoth√©e Chalamet, as Dylan, absolutely blew me away. He embodies the iconic folk singer with such nuance and authenticity, effortlessly channeling Dylan‚Äôs energy, complexity, and rebellious spirit. Chalamet‚Äôs portrayal captures the essence of a young man caught between fame and his own desire for independence, all while bringing his own interpretation to Dylan‚Äôs legend. It‚Äôs more than just mimicking the voice; it‚Äôs an emotional performance that hits all the right notes. Edward Norton, as Pete Seeger, delivers a wonderfully grounded and layered performance, contrasting Chalamet‚Äôs youthful intensity with Seeger‚Äôs seasoned wisdom. Their dynamic was brilliantly performed ‚Äî a perfect blend of mentorship and friction between the old guard and the new wave of music. The film balances its historical context with personal drama, creating an engaging portrait of Dylan‚Äôs evolution. It‚Äôs a must-see for music lovers and anyone curious about the figures who shaped the 60s counterculture, and Chalamet and Norton‚Äôs stellar performances alone make it a memorable watch."

    "review": "A Complete Unknown is a well-crafted biopic with a protagonist, who is far from being likeable. The protagonist is not likeable and that's the biggest negative aspect of the film. He treats people very poorly and that was hard to root for. The supporting characters are great though. I liked most of them, but the most sympathetic is probably Sylvie and my favourite is Pete. The dialogues are well-written, the story is intriguing. The cinematography is beautiful, I enjoy how James Mangold lights his movies. He is also amazing as the writer-director, because he managed to make me root for such a bad person for most of the movie. The production design is beautiful. I've never heard Bob Dylan songs before, but I enjoyed them very much here. The casting is amazing, the acting performances alike. A Complete Unknown is technically very well-done with the issue of the main character being a jerk."

    "review": "The movie does not disappoint. It was full of Dylan's music, his story of getting started in folk, and then his transition to electric. I think Chalamet is amazing, but so is the rest of the cast. Edward Norton was fantastic. It was a great movie to see in the theater. Nicely paced and not too long. I'll see it again, I'm sure."
