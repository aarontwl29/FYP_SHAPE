      "review": "first thing i felt was the familiar bond between this new silly yet family-coded crew. watched it for Yelena and Bucky, and left the cinema loving Bob, Walker, Alexei and Ava more. currently rewatching their first appearance! the whole movie was just mind-blowing beyond words and i don't even know where to start. the cast, the plot, the messages, the chemistry, of course all of it was perfect. Totally a very refreshing start of the new MCU phase. i hope they keep on making these kind of marvel movies, cuz u know, it brings back memories and just feels nostalgic. I love how Bucky's character keep developing in every movie, how he kept trying to do the right thing despite his past. all of them. they all tried, TOGETHER. this is what made the MCU movies mean a lot to me. it's my childhood, my teenage, and now my almost adult company. MUST SEE!!! 100%!! may i add,, thank you director and all staffs for Bucky's stunning look on the credit scene üëèüèª it's been in my mind ever since the first date the film was released, the day i watched it. i wish i could watch it again for the first time."

Bucky and Yelena have great chemistry, and their evolving relationship is one of the film‚Äôs highlights. Bucky‚Äôs quiet strength and inner conflict contrast well with Yelena‚Äôs sharp humor and determination, creating a bond that feels both tense and heartfelt. Their scenes together bring depth to the story and show how two very different people can begin to understand and support each other. It‚Äôs a darker, more character-driven Marvel film, and it works really well. I SHIP YELENA AND BOB SO HARD DUDE"

      "review": "It was alright, not Infinity War levels of brilliance, but you only catch lightening in a bottle once. Character arcs were pretty descent, the storyline was okay and the humor gets the job done more times than not I guess. The weakness begins at the final act which much like Captain Falcon Soldier scrambles and stumbles over itself. The final act aforementioned feels forced, directionless and rushed to a point where it doesn't feel like a satisfying ending was reached. The act only scratched the surface of grief, depression and bottled up emotional trauma without taking a deeper approach as to how it affects the actors decisions and how it has overall impacted them as people, and then proceeding to give us an emotional conclusion and pay off at the end."

      "review": "Thunderbolts* - 10/10 I went into Thunderbolts* expecting another passable MCU side project. What I got was something far more layered, intense, and emotionally honest than I thought Marvel still had in them. The real star here is Bob Reynolds (Sentry) and Lewis Pullman delivers an absolutely devastating performance. His portrayal of a man being torn apart by something as internal as it is cosmic hits hard. The Void isn‚Äôt just a villain ‚Äî it‚Äôs a metaphor for depression, guilt, intrusive thoughts‚Ä¶ and the movie commits to that. It‚Äôs not just surface-level ‚Äúdark side‚Äù stuff ‚Äî it actually feels like they consulted people who understand what living with that kind of mind feels like. And Pullman nails it. Jake Schreier (director) and Joanna Calo (co-writer) deserve credit for steering this thing in a more grounded, character-driven direction. The themes don‚Äôt get lost in CGI noise. There‚Äôs action, sure, but the real weight is in the character dynamics ‚Äî especially between Yelena and Bob. Florence Pugh keeps Yelena sharp, sarcastic, and emotionally complex. Their connection is the core of the film, and it works because the script lets them have quiet, human moments. The rest of the team isn‚Äôt just there for filler either. Bucky, Ava, and even Walker have actual arcs. The writing gives them space to be messy, conflicted, and still worth rooting for. And the cinematography + score elevate everything ‚Äî no Marvel gloss here. The darker tone feels earned. Look, I‚Äôm not here to throw flowers at Marvel as a brand ‚Äî they‚Äôve been phoning it in for a while. But this? This is the rare case where individual talent broke through the studio formula. It‚Äôs not trying to sell you a franchise. It‚Äôs telling a story about people trying to survive themselves. And it‚Äôs brutal in the best way. Thunderbolts* isn‚Äôt perfect, but it hits where it counts. Real emotion. Real stakes. Real characters. That‚Äôs rare ‚Äî especially in a Marvel movie. 10/10. Not because it‚Äôs flawless ‚Äî but because it fk'ing matters."

In reality it was a poor film that spent too much time on a pointless plot line and ruined what could have been a great film, then when the real action was bout to start, they rushed through what could have been an epic beat down on the 'good guys' and had an absolutely awful climax. I understand that we want to show that love conquers all, and that the misfits around the world can always find a family, but they managed to defeat arguably the most terrifying bad guy in recent times by giving him a cuddle!

The movie has even more to often as it has every marvel fans dream. 2 post credit scenes and one of which hints at avengers doomsday! just like how the other avenagers films lead to thanos in their post credits which made fans cort in and desperate to watch the next film and even films ages away from release."

It's got a great cast, a fun, heartwarming and interesting plot, plenty of action and a stand out performance from Florence Pugh. The rest of the cast are not far behind when it comes to their acting. My daughter's seen it twice. I plan to watch it again. I found myself laughing and even crying a bit. Mental health issues that can be so clumsily portrayed are handled here with a deft touch and compassion and the villainess (played by an actress normally known for her comic roles) manages to be charismatic, funny and yet truly intimidating. The actress who plays Ghost is also particularly good, but as I've already said all the performances are excellent."

      "review": "This is a perfect showcase how deep the MCU has fallen, when this is supposed to be a good MCU movie now. It's true, if I squint a lot ignoring flaws it is decent. It has some nice scenes - action and character moments - some fun banter and a plot and villain that at least tries to be more than a punching bag for the heroes, something with depth. The problem is, those are rare small sparks and in the overall product they feel forced. This is the most true of Yelena and her \"character development\", arguably the character to carry the plot and movie the most. It feels so shoehorned in to try and turn her into the role her sister filled trying to mix this into her own arc of realizing that you can do more than kill for money and the job. Which feels weird since she already was beyond that in Black Widow and the Hawkeye series arguably and those pivotal moments from both the movie and the series barely feel connected to her current situation. The main plot has multiple moments that make either the main characters or the villains feel incredibly stupid without making it explainable by character flaws. Thor in its original movie being a dickhead is part of his character arc and that explains some of the \"bad decisions\" he makes. Here that works for some characters, but then it's inexplicable why others in the same group follow along. There is superficial conflict in the characters, that is swept aside when convenient but so much potential lost in dealing with actual conflicts or finding different solutions to the main problems to fuel their banter. The main villain and their plot line, such a good premise, and I give it that they at least go a bit further than with WandaVision and actually stick with the more interesting resolution than beating up a villain to resolve it - in essence. However, the plot still feels idiotic and underwhelming. On the positive side, some small aspects managed to subvert expectations - the problem is, mostly the change feels more cringe than the cliche plotline it replaces (with another cliche, mostly dumb side-villain or hero). The ending is pretty unsatisfying and setting up the next movies in the canon universe with more problems. We have a say, ambivalent, character with superman level powers rivaling if not surpassing the established heroes and villains, the sub-villain is still around and could actually spin the whole movie plot as a win for themselves (despite not getting exactly what they wanted, granted) - so on that front nothing is resolved. It feels the purpose of the movie solely was to form the team. And it was pretty tedious or that. Normally the team introduction movies are fun. All in all there is too much stuffed into this movie again, trying to please everyone with quirky references, different types of plots (a bit political thriller, a bit mental health, a bit classical villain, a bit purpose finding etc) and in the process at least not pleasing me. For like about half the movie I was somewhat entertained, the other half I was actively annoyed. There are two reasons I didn't walk out: I had to spend the time anyway waiting for a travel connection and I could use my phone in the theater to distract me. If that's not a damning summary, I don't know what is. I guess going on a rampage. Now, part of my annoyance might stem from the fact that the trailers at least gave some hope and the movie had it's moments where it looked like it could find its way, but then it would drag on and torpedo all its progress again..."

I deeply enjoyed this film as a long-time Marvel fan along with my wife (who has zero knowledge of this stuff) because the themes are relatable. Each character deals with grief, irrelevance, regret, disappointment, and loss in a way that resonates with the audience. I read some really harsh reviews, but I actually enjoyed the film a lot more than I thought I would. It's not a perfect film, by any means. However, it does keep a really tight grip on the plot and doesn't muddy the waters too much with the ensemble cast, instead (wisely) choosing to focus on the three main leads. Their arcs are compelling, emotional, and real. I do wish that some of the characters had more time to bond and that some of the plot devices weren't so obvious (such as visible countdown timers for traps and easily located bomb power supplies), but they don't detract from the emotional beats. I liked that they take their name from Yelena's childhood team, the \"Thunderbolts,\" a soccer team that \"never won a game.\" Phrasing is important -- it's not that they're losers, it's just that they've never won. To date, each character is dealing with 'victories' that are either morally gray or pyrrhic, so they all feel like underachievers. As underdogs, it's hard not to root for them."

      "review": "I'm often a super hero movie skeptic. The worst super hero movies wind up being the all powerful hero versus the indestructible villain gallavanting through a city causing massive destruction amounting to nothing. Thunderbolts* felt like the antithesis of this. Every one of the characters was very human and very flawed. None -- even the powerful villain, was indestructible. And much of the movie actually focused on the very real issue of mental health. Multiple of the characters were grappling with mental health making them feel all that more real and human. On top of this, the writing was pretty humorous. Florence Pugh and David Harbour had the best characters, constantly throwing out witty one liners. And Julia Louis-Dreyfus was surprisingly good as Tulsi Gabbard -- I mean the evil CIA director. I never remember any of the broader plot lines from the Marvel universe and there were definitely a lot of references back to things that happened that I no longer remember from past movies. But it never felt like it mattered that I didn't remember. Overall it was a well put together, humorous movie that seemed to have a much more meaningful point than many vacuous superhero movies."

With a cast of familiar faces and morally gray heroes, the film strikes a great balance between gritty action and sharp wit. The acting is consistently solid across the board, with returning characters like Yelena Belova and Bucky Barnes stealing scenes with both emotional depth and comedic timing. The chemistry between the team is believable, messy, and entertaining‚Äîjust what you‚Äôd want from a group of reluctant allies. The writing is smart and refreshingly character-driven, with enough humor to keep things light without undercutting the stakes. Action sequences are punchy, well-choreographed, and serve the story rather than overwhelm it. Thunderbolts may not reinvent the genre, but it doesn't need to. It's a reminder that Marvel still knows how to deliver a fun, engaging, and well-made superhero movie when it stays focused. A solid win that earns its place in the lineup."

It wasn't a coincidence that the film was also released during mental awareness month or that each character has had their fair share of pain and trauma. from the writing to acting, I wanted more. I crave more from the dynamic. This type of misfit team up, reminiscent of the Avengers 2012 film, is exactly what's been missing especially since guardians are no more.

Although tears and praise come out of me, I have to admit there are a few improvements this movie could take: 1. When the rest of the team enters the Void, it doesn‚Äôt show any scene development, rather than suddenly appearing while Yelena and Bob were in the attic. You could add how they got into the Void, face their fears, so that the plot thickens. 2.Taskmaster was killed off too fast, we haven‚Äôt gotten to known her entire story, if she had survived, we would have gotten to explore the character‚Äôs personality and embrace her into the MCU. 3. In the post-credits scene, there is a scene where the Fantastic Four ship appears in Earth-19999, this however spoils some of the details of the upcoming movie ‚ÄúFantastic Four: First Steps‚Äù. Marvel Studios shouldn‚Äôt have been too eager to show that to the audience as to add suspense and thriller.  So after my essay review of this movie, I would rate an 7.8/10, which would mark up to IMDb‚Äôs standards."

Interesting & engaging overall without getting lost in out of context scenes."

The acting from Florence Pugh and Lewis Pullman are Oscar worthy, esspecially Pullman. My only gripe would be the way they handled Taskmaster. Why in the movie about second chances does the character who arguably deserves a second chance most of all get merced within 10 minutes. With the original,plan for Taskmaster out in the public eyes I beleive that it would have made the movie even better and given Ghost a bit more to do. But that's my only gripe with the movie. A return to what the MCU was before Disney"

You made that I really wanted from Marvel movies anf from other movies at all. You made excellent emotional story with deep meaning. ƒ∞n old Marvel movies creators used rude jokes that I didn't like it and other viewers too. But in this film jokes aren't rude and they are really kind and funny, also make movie better. Visual effects and stunts made on high level, this was incredible work. Run time is good 2 hours 6 minutes. ƒ∞t is important, because if it become 3 hours, not all people can watch it. For example, I didn't watch Avengers:Infinity war and Avengers:Endgame. Run time was long and too many long boring scenes. But in this movie all scenes are interesting. This movie's age rating is PG-13, especially for thematic elements and action. But we can advise this movie to watch with family and children elder six years, everyone will enjoy it. Actors are great, roles played excellent, characters are amazing. Especially we must note soundtrack. Music is absolutely great, which adds to film all characters' feelings. That's why you feel all actions even without 4DX. And I liked chemistry between characters, it was better than in other Marvel projects. Team worked really hard on this project. And the most important thing was humanity feeling in our characters, their soul pains and becoming hero, because they want to help people, how they can. Kindness and importance of humanity feeling than superpower, makes movie one the best of all time. I never could choose the best Marvel movie for myself (I was between Iron man and Spider-man), but now I know. For me it is the best movie from Marvel Studios. Thank you very much for this amazing movie! Can't wait to see Thunderbolts* in Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, and in next movies. Let's go New Avengers! Thank you again!"

There was something deeper there, some Carl Jung style exploration of the shadow self. But it came way too late. The rest of the movie, like a full hour and 45 minutes, was just nonstop banter and silliness. No one was playing the real stakes of any situation. It‚Äôs like every Marvel character now has to sound like they‚Äôre in a Deadpool movie or some Thor Love and Thunder spinoff. Who at Marvel decided that‚Äôs the only way these movies can work? It‚Äôs exhausting. The thing is, humor can work really well in these films but only when it comes from character and from real emotion. Like with Robert Downey Jr.‚Äôs Iron Man. When he made a joke it felt earned. It came from pain or stress or just trying to stay sane in the middle of chaos. But now it‚Äôs just quip after quip for no reason and it kills any tension or emotional weight. Bottom line, I left the theater more annoyed than anything. There was potential but most of it was buried under cheap jokes and lazy writing."

These characters are broken, but they all find each other and like some weird superhero support group, manage to do the one thing that superheroes stopped doing in these films... they save the people. They're not looking to stop some cataclysmic, world ending event or cut the head off of a maniacal villain. Meanwhile dealing with real issues that haven't been touched upon very much (if at all) in these type of films. Trauma, self-harm, abuse, etc. Honestly, I haven't teared up in front of a superhero film since Black Panther. Lewis Pullman steals the show and his chemistry with Florence Pugh is a cinematic chef's kiss. There's laughs where they belong as well, with David Harbour nailing ever bit he was given. There are some things that could've been left out and naturally some things that needed further exploration. Like Julia Louis-Dreyfus who should've played a straight-laced hard case instead of Selina Meyer 2.0 Maybe there's an extended cut that delves more into the experiences of Ghost and Red Guardian, we don't get enough of their backstory. This is due to the fact that you're expected to know already. For the record, I don't care for the connected universe trope. Especially when we have to do our homework to know what's going on. That being said, I've been riding with Marvel from year one, so I know what's going on. Thunderbolts* falls short on a few things but it hits everywhere that truly matters and that's enough for me."

It was cool with ghost coming back that filled in a plot hole she was missing and her character arc was great. The negatives you have the comic book clich√©s with the city in peril. They disposed one of the characters there was nothing giving to that character. Another clich√© that the amnesia it‚Äôs like almost in every anime and wolverine has that. Positives character moments you get there, father daughter, dynamic, red guardian and Yelena. creative how they show the flashbacks with Sentries powers to get to see in their heads. The messages what makes a hero, facing trauma, facing your demons. Finding your place in the world. Another negative Walker I don‚Äôt get why everyone said they loved him. He‚Äôs a supposedly fan favorite. Cinematography in one scene particular when century is in the prison, they have evil Elaine from Seinfeld is talking to him and he had this great visual on this orange lighting. Some landscape shots are really nice. When Valentina is in the building when you see the pillars in the background as a cool shot. The action there‚Äôs awesome hand to hand combat fighting. The aesthetic is a grimy look similar to the Boys but a PG-13 version. The definite delight of the film, red guardian, funny and brings energy into the film.
