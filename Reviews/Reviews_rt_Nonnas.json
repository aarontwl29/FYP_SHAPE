    "review": "A truly heartfelt look into the family-oriented nature of Italian culture as well as the processing of grief. This film reenforces the important reality that our elders can still engage with the world around them and overcome the isolation and uselessness that, sadly, many often feel. Vince Vaughn does an impeccable job taking on a more serious role while still maintaining nuances of his cheerful personality, all without leaning too heavily on his comedic performance experiences. Susan Sarandon also adds a comical but meaningful role supporting and creating strong, confident female figures for all to love. This feel-good movie is definitely worth the watch. With that said, there are elements that feel glossed over in the plot, unrealistic at times, that detract from its technical value as a film. Great family movie but nothing worth cinematic praise."

I really appreciated how it celebrates starting fresh at any age and shows that life‚Äôs most rewarding chapters can begin later than expected. The fact that it‚Äôs based on a true story made it all the more heartwarming and inspiring. The performances were sincere and well-executed, and the whole cast brought a real sense of warmth and authenticity to the screen. It‚Äôs a comforting, uplifting watch ‚Äî highly recommended if you‚Äôre looking for something that blends heart, humor, and hope."

    "review": "Nonnas is a deeply moving film that envelops viewers in warmth, much like a comforting embrace from a beloved grandmother. The movie draws inspiration from the true story of Joe Scaravella, portrayed with sincerity by Vince Vaughn. After the loss of his mother, Joe seeks solace and purpose by opening Enoteca Maria, a Staten Island restaurant staffed entirely by Italian grandmothers‚Äîor \"nonnas\"‚Äîeach bringing their unique culinary traditions to the table. The ensemble cast delivers performances that resonate with authenticity and heart: Vince Vaughn as Joe Scaravella: Embodies a man navigating grief, channeling his love into a venture that honors his family's legacy. Susan Sarandon as Gia: Portrays a spirited nonna whose passion for cooking is matched only by her zest for life. Lorraine Bracco as Roberta: Delivers a nuanced performance as a nonna whose dishes are infused with deep-rooted traditions. Talia Shire as Teresa: Brings warmth and wisdom, capturing the essence of a matriarch who sees cooking as an act of love. Brenda Vaccaro as Antonella: Offers a delightful blend of humor and heart, portraying a nonna whose stories are as rich as her recipes. Linda Cardellini as Olivia: Plays Joe's high school crush, adding layers of romantic tension and personal growth to the narrative. Joe Manganiello as Bruno: Acts as Joe's steadfast friend and contractor, providing both comic relief and unwavering support. The film is a tapestry of intergenerational relationships, cultural heritage, and the healing power of food. Each scene is imbued with emotion, from the clatter of pots in the kitchen to the shared laughter around the dinner table. The nonnas' interactions‚Äîsometimes clashing, often heartwarming‚Äîhighlight the beauty of diverse traditions coming together. Nonnas doesn't just tell a story; it invites viewers into a world where love is measured in ladles of sauce and memories are baked into every loaf of bread. It's a cinematic experience that leaves the heart full and the spirit uplifted. Rating: 9/10 ‚Äì A heartfelt homage to family, tradition, and the universal language of food."

But the writing is leaden, the plot uuum simplistic, and the main character is so one dimensional that we never find out in the entire movie if he has a life other than his mom. It's sad to see such a waste. But... if you want a heavy dose of schmaltz, leavened with a nod at Italian cooking, and plot developments that are signaled in neon, then far be it for me to rescue your two hours of your life."

A guy who lacks ambition finds a purpose. Another negative - Does Vince play the part well? I think so, though at first I wasn't sure until I analyzed the background. He is not a native born Italian and does not pronounce the words he knows with the correct accent, but in the film, probably only his grandparents spoke it. I'm Italian and am amazed at how many in similar households do not remember the language, but remember nonna's cooking. THIS is what the movie is about. I though casting Susan Sarandon as a grandmother was extremely far fetched until I googled her real age - she looks FANTASTIC, and her character - a hair dresser who is into fashion - turns out perfectly cast. Overall, a film that make you feel good."

I would have said that it was an ok time waster, except that they deliberately put in an story in order to take a shot at the Catholic Church - and it wasn't even true ,in a movie that was based on a true story. No \"nonna\" left the convent to cook in that restaurant. So boring and stupid. Why bother to change the story for the sole purpose of degrading Catholics? When is Hollywood going to grow up? \"Bigotry is so wrong\" - unless it's against Catholics. Give me a break! Turn off your brain and watch the movie if you want - but don't say I didn't warn you!"

    "review": "Nonnas is a heartwarming gem that left me smiling through tears and craving a plate of homemade pasta. This 2025 comedy-drama, streaming on Netflix, is a love letter to family, heritage, and the messy, beautiful bonds that hold us together. Directed by Stephen Chbosky, the film follows Joe (Vince Vaughn), a guy in over his head when his Brooklyn pizzeria is taken over by a trio of feisty Italian grandmothers‚Äîplayed with irresistible charm by Brenda Vaccaro, Linda Cardellini, and Talia Shire. These nonnas don‚Äôt just sling dough; they dish out life lessons, sharp wit, and enough love to mend a broken heart. The story is simple but soulful: Joe, grappling with grief and a failing business, finds unexpected salvation in the nonnas‚Äô old-school recipes and unfiltered wisdom. What could‚Äôve been a clich√© culture-clash comedy soars thanks to the cast‚Äôs chemistry and a script that knows when to lean into humor and when to tug at your heartstrings. The nonnas steal every scene, their banter as spicy as their marinara, but Vaughn‚Äôs understated vulnerability grounds the film, making Joe‚Äôs redemption arc genuinely moving. Cardellini‚Äôs dual role as a nonna and Joe‚Äôs sister adds layers of warmth, while Shire‚Äôs quiet strength is pure magic. The Brooklyn setting feels alive, with cozy visuals and a soundtrack of Italian classics that wrap you like a warm hug. The film celebrates Italian-American culture without caricature, weaving in themes of tradition and resilience that hit home no matter your background. At 104 minutes, it‚Äôs perfectly paced, leaving you full but not overstuffed. Nonnas is the cinematic equivalent of Sunday dinner at grandma‚Äôs‚Äîcomforting, joyful, and unforgettable. Five stars for a movie that reminds us love and good food can fix almost anything."

Oh, the love interest masks herself with wedding rings, or we get repeated Capuzzella references, which my mom used to cook butterflied with doors locked and promises of secrecy. Both regional and borough orientation tensions become tired clich√©s rather than subtle distinctions. Near-tragic, often long-term familial thorns are simply glossed over or quickly solved.

Was it perfect? No. But if you have an Italian grandma, you know that perfection is never to be expected (except by them). If you feel that food can be an expression of love, you‚Äôll appreciate this movie. Sit back with a full stomach, a nice bottle of wine, and enjoy."

The story is as stale as the washed up actors mailing it in every scene. Dead Internet Theory propping up the ratings."

The actors were selected so carefully that really fit the characters and it felt like I was watching the real people it was based on. I thought the food fight was so fun! The movie did such a great job of showing what it means to be a true friend, and to not sacrifice friendship over material things. I also loved seeing the real people at the end that the movie was based on. I really think this movie needs to be seen by a lot of people today and has such a meaningful message about community, meaningful friendships, and family"

    "review": "\"Nonnas\" is a lighthearted comedy set to be released in 2025, featuring Vince Vaughn, Linda Cardellini, and Susan Sarandon. The plot centers around Vaughn's character, who dreams of opening a restaurant that serves dishes prepared by local grandmothers, aiming to evoke a sense of nostalgia and comfort for diners. Throughout the film, he faces numerous challenges, including passing health inspections, securing funding, managing his day job, and exploring a budding romance with the character played by Cardellini. While Vaughn's comedic style has its charm, I find it hard to take him seriously in this role, as he has a history of portraying unconvincing characters. In my opinion, a different lead actor might have brought more depth to the emotional connection with his grandmother and mother, which is central to the story. Overall, \"Nonnas\" is a decent watch. It‚Äôs not a complete disaster, and it's available on Netflix, so I‚Äôd suggest giving it a try if you're looking for something to enjoy. However, Vaughn's performance felt somewhat lackluster to me, lacking the emotional weight needed. Additionally, Sarandon‚Äôs character, a hairdresser, is oddly reduced to discussions about her appearance rather than being given a more substantial role, which seems out of place for such a renowned actress."

    "review": "The perfect heartwarming Netflix movie for Mother‚Äôs Day weekend! Director Stephen Chbosky‚Äôs Netflix comedy-drama Nonnas (2025) is certainly a pleasant surprise. Chbosky‚Äôs direction keeps things light and family oriented. His respect for his characters, their families, and Italian traditions is all nice. Writer Liz Maccie‚Äôs script is very kindhearted and funny. She comes up with a bunch of fussy Italian grandmothers and their families for a riot of a kitchen comedy. It‚Äôs like Chef or any other number of family comedies, but with a wonderful ensemble cast. Vince Vaughn is surprisingly touching as the grieving Joe Scaravella. He gets to flex his dramatic chops here in an unusually compelling serious role. Seeing him bumble with setting up an Italian restaurant. Michael Rispoli is good as the ultra serious Al, who is skeptical of Joe‚Äôs designs for his Italian restaurant. Campbell Scott gets a neat cameo as Edward Durant. Susan Sarandon is still a smokeshow as the hilarious and endearing pastry chef Gia. The humor based around her voluptuous figure and low cut shirts is hysterical. Lorraine Bracco is funny and moving as the lively Roberta, who takes up being a chef to get out of the retirement home. Bracco gets to be the angry Sicilian chef in the kitchen. She can still act well and it‚Äôs nice to see her after The Sopranos. Talia Shire is fantastic as the sweet and shy nun turned chef Teresa. She‚Äôs very lovable and a nice foil for the other more excitable grandmothers. Brenda Vaccaro is likable as elderly lady Antonella. She‚Äôs quite bubbly as the grandmother from Bologna. She goes from grumpy to happy as a chef. Linda Cardellini is lovely, pleasant, charming, funny, and natural as Joe‚Äôs love interest Olivia. She comes across as so sweet and genuine. Cardellini brings out Vaughn‚Äôs warmer side. Drea de Matteo is gorgeous, tough, and caring as the fiery Stella. She‚Äôs so skeptical, funny, intense, and sexy that it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs still portraying Adrianna La Cerva on The Sopranos. I appreciate that she gets to worry and be genuinely concerned for Joe. Her astonishment at Joe‚Äôs ideas is quite fun. Joe Manganiello is fun as the flippant best friend Bruno with an attitude, pragmatic approach, and blunt manner. Overall, Nonnas is a cute and charming 114 minutes with a delightful ensemble."

My 3 daughters have carried her recipes into their homes today - for their husbands and 2 kids (each) Knowing this is a REAL story made it all that more entertaining - LOTS of FOOD and LOTS of LOVE coming from that kitchen."

I laughed out loud once or twice and heard myself ‚Äúaw shucks‚Äù a time or two, so you know this movie hits you in the feels. The direction is pedestrian and doesn‚Äôt reach the melodious heights of Stephen Chbosky‚Äôs first film (The Perks of Being a Wallflower), but overall it works for this material.

If you‚Äôre not Italian American, and you love your family, this movie will feel like being in the kitchen with your family. From beginning to end this movie makes you feel good. It‚Äôs Vince Vaughn bringing such humanity to an every man. He has the rare presence of a movie star every time he‚Äôs on screen. The NONNAS (Brenda Vaccaro, Lorraine Bracco, Talia Shire, and Susan Sarandon) are four of the greatest Italian American actresses ever. They are cinematic royalty. They are as iconic together as they are hysterical. They will make you laugh, chair, and cry. The film is also timeless and has echoes of all the classic Italian American stories. I always stop movies when I watch them at home to get a snack, I did not stop this movie once. I was so taken into this world by the writing, the directing, and the warmest acting. You want to watch it a few times and at one time or more you‚Äôll want to watch it with your mother or your Nonna."
