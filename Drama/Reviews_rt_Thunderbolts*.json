    "review": "Unless you're a die-hard fan, you won't recognize these characters, but what you will recognize is people dealing with trauma. I deeply enjoyed this film as a long-time Marvel fan along with my wife (who has zero knowledge of this stuff) because the themes are relatable. Each character deals with grief, irrelevance, regret, disappointment, and loss in a way that resonates with the audience. I read some really harsh reviews, but I actually enjoyed the film a lot more than I thought I would. It's not a perfect film, by any means. However, it does keep a really tight grip on the plot and doesn't muddy the waters too much with the ensemble cast, instead (wisely) choosing to focus on the three main leads. Their arcs are compelling, emotional, and real. I do wish that some of the characters had more time to bond and that some of the plot devices weren't so obvious (such as visible countdown timers for traps and easily located bomb power supplies), but they don't detract from the emotional beats. I liked that they take their name from Yelena's childhood team, the \"Thunderbolts,\" a soccer team that \"never won a game.\" Phrasing is important -- it's not that they're losers, it's just that they've never won. To date, each character is dealing with 'victories' that are either morally gray or pyrrhic, so they all feel like underachievers. As underdogs, it's hard not to root for them."

Not sure if I liked it so much because of how disappointing a lot of stuff has been recently from marvel and it was a breath of fresh air. Or if it‚Äôs actually good on its own.

    "review": "I'm often a super hero movie skeptic. The worst super hero movies wind up being the all powerful hero versus the indestructible villain gallavanting through a city causing massive destruction amounting to nothing. Thunderbolts* felt like the antithesis of this. Every one of the characters was very human and very flawed. None -- even the powerful villain, was indestructible. And much of the movie actually focused on the very real issue of mental health. Multiple of the characters were grappling with mental health making them feel all that more real and human. On top of this, the writing was pretty humorous. Florence Pugh and David Harbour had the best characters, constantly throwing out witty one liners. And Julia Louis-Dreyfus was surprisingly good as Tulsi Gabbard -- I mean the evil CIA director. I never remember any of the broader plot lines from the Marvel universe and there were definitely a lot of references back to things that happened that I no longer remember from past movies. But it never felt like it mattered that I didn't remember. Overall it was a well put together, humorous movie that seemed to have a much more meaningful point than many vacuous superhero movies."

With a cast of familiar faces and morally gray heroes, the film strikes a great balance between gritty action and sharp wit. The acting is consistently solid across the board, with returning characters like Yelena Belova and Bucky Barnes stealing scenes with both emotional depth and comedic timing. The chemistry between the team is believable, messy, and entertaining‚Äîjust what you‚Äôd want from a group of reluctant allies. The writing is smart and refreshingly character-driven, with enough humor to keep things light without undercutting the stakes. Action sequences are punchy, well-choreographed, and serve the story rather than overwhelm it. Thunderbolts may not reinvent the genre, but it doesn't need to. It's a reminder that Marvel still knows how to deliver a fun, engaging, and well-made superhero movie when it stays focused. A solid win that earns its place in the lineup."

Stayed in my room. Threw myself in my art & writing. I had no friends to talk too truly about how I felt in my head or thoughts of .. ending it. It wasn't a coincidence that the film was also released during mental awareness month or that each character has had their fair share of pain and trauma. from the writing to acting, I wanted more. I crave more from the dynamic. This type of misfit team up, reminiscent of the Avengers 2012 film, is exactly what's been missing especially since guardians are no more. My only issues was, I wanted more Bucky, I wanted to see more of his life, home, job. Bucky is constantly getting the short end of the stick. (Just to clarify my sis is still alive, lmao)"

    "review": "This film is unlike any other Marvel film I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs an group of unlikely heroes going on an emotional journey while stopping the antagonists of this film. Although tears and praise come out of me, I have to admit there are a few improvements this movie could take: 1. When the rest of the team enters the Void, it doesn‚Äôt show any scene development, rather than suddenly appearing while Yelena and Bob were in the attic. You could add how they got into the Void, face their fears, so that the plot thickens. 2.Taskmaster was killed off too fast, we haven‚Äôt gotten to known her entire story, if she had survived, we would have gotten to explore the character‚Äôs personality and embrace her into the MCU. 3. In the post-credits scene, there is a scene where the Fantastic Four ship appears in Earth-19999, this however spoils some of the details of the upcoming movie ‚ÄúFantastic Four: First Steps‚Äù. Marvel Studios shouldn‚Äôt have been too eager to show that to the audience as to add suspense and thriller.  So after my essay review of this movie, I would rate an 7.8/10, which would mark up to IMDb‚Äôs standards."

Keep a handle on the bar so it doesn‚Äôt go so high nothing else in its own universe can compete). I unexpectedly & happily really liked this Film.

The acting from Florence Pugh and Lewis Pullman are Oscar worthy, esspecially Pullman. My only gripe would be the way they handled Taskmaster. Why in the movie about second chances does the character who arguably deserves a second chance most of all get merced within 10 minutes. With the original,plan for Taskmaster out in the public eyes I beleive that it would have made the movie even better and given Ghost a bit more to do. But that's my only gripe with the movie. A return to what the MCU was before Disney"

You made that I really wanted from Marvel movies anf from other movies at all. You made excellent emotional story with deep meaning. ƒ∞n old Marvel movies creators used rude jokes that I didn't like it and other viewers too. But in this film jokes aren't rude and they are really kind and funny, also make movie better. Visual effects and stunts made on high level, this was incredible work. Run time is good 2 hours 6 minutes. ƒ∞t is important, because if it become 3 hours, not all people can watch it. For example, I didn't watch Avengers:Infinity war and Avengers:Endgame. Run time was long and too many long boring scenes. But in this movie all scenes are interesting. This movie's age rating is PG-13, especially for thematic elements and action. But we can advise this movie to watch with family and children elder six years, everyone will enjoy it. Actors are great, roles played excellent, characters are amazing. Especially we must note soundtrack. Music is absolutely great, which adds to film all characters' feelings. That's why you feel all actions even without 4DX. And I liked chemistry between characters, it was better than in other Marvel projects. Team worked really hard on this project. And the most important thing was humanity feeling in our characters, their soul pains and becoming hero, because they want to help people, how they can. Kindness and importance of humanity feeling than superpower, makes movie one the best of all time. I never could choose the best Marvel movie for myself (I was between Iron man and Spider-man), but now I know. For me it is the best movie from Marvel Studios. Thank you very much for this amazing movie! Can't wait to see Thunderbolts* in Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, and in next movies. Let's go New Avengers! Thank you again!"

Now that I have seen it, I can say that the movie is good but I would not say it was amazing. I feel like people have just been really starved for a good movie from Marvel. Also, everything (or mostly everything) that has come out before this in the MCU hasn‚Äôt been very good so the bar is pretty low right now. But it still definitely worth the watch. The performances are solid, with Florence Pugh and David Harbour standing out, and the action sequences are satisfying to watch. The movie never really drags either and has good pacing, and it tackles some interesting themes not seen often in the MCU."

Also there was a character who they did go into their backstory but I feel like they still could‚Äôve done a better job at exploring the character. It‚Äôs definitely a fun watch and has a great message but the character development could‚Äôve been better."

Florence Pugh is absolutely wonderful in this film. I cannot applaude her enough. Her acting was so of the best in the movie. Her monologue scenes were magnificent. Lewis Pullman... man, your characters life story plus your range in acting... man, I felt like you had gotten ahold of my journal. Thank you for this piece of art man. You encapsulated everything it meant to be a better version of yourself. And how to get there.... is never a path walked alone. The other actors. David Harbour's Alexei was another wonderful entry to his already astounding resume. I expected him to shine bright, and man, he really did. As a father myself, his emotions during the lowest and highest moments of the film. Just peak cinema. Over the top. Good on you sir. It was an amazing movie. Please go see it.

There was something deeper there, some Carl Jung style exploration of the shadow self. But it came way too late. The rest of the movie, like a full hour and 45 minutes, was just nonstop banter and silliness. No one was playing the real stakes of any situation. It‚Äôs like every Marvel character now has to sound like they‚Äôre in a Deadpool movie or some Thor Love and Thunder spinoff. Who at Marvel decided that‚Äôs the only way these movies can work? It‚Äôs exhausting. The thing is, humor can work really well in these films but only when it comes from character and from real emotion. Like with Robert Downey Jr.‚Äôs Iron Man. When he made a joke it felt earned. It came from pain or stress or just trying to stay sane in the middle of chaos. But now it‚Äôs just quip after quip for no reason and it kills any tension or emotional weight. Bottom line, I left the theater more annoyed than anything. There was potential but most of it was buried under cheap jokes and lazy writing."

    "review": "Thunderbolts* is the movie that not only gives you great action sequences and funny moments, it goes for your heart. These characters are broken, but they all find each other and like some weird superhero support group, manage to do the one thing that superheroes stopped doing in these films... they save the people. They're not looking to stop some cataclysmic, world ending event or cut the head off of a maniacal villain. Meanwhile dealing with real issues that haven't been touched upon very much (if at all) in these type of films. Trauma, self-harm, abuse, etc. Honestly, I haven't teared up in front of a superhero film since Black Panther. Lewis Pullman steals the show and his chemistry with Florence Pugh is a cinematic chef's kiss. There's laughs where they belong as well, with David Harbour nailing ever bit he was given. There are some things that could've been left out and naturally some things that needed further exploration. Like Julia Louis-Dreyfus who should've played a straight-laced hard case instead of Selina Meyer 2.0 Maybe there's an extended cut that delves more into the experiences of Ghost and Red Guardian, we don't get enough of their backstory. This is due to the fact that you're expected to know already. For the record, I don't care for the connected universe trope. Especially when we have to do our homework to know what's going on. That being said, I've been riding with Marvel from year one, so I know what's going on. Thunderbolts* falls short on a few things but it hits everywhere that truly matters and that's enough for me."

It was cool with ghost coming back that filled in a plot hole she was missing and her character arc was great. The negatives you have the comic book clich√©s with the city in peril. They disposed one of the characters there was nothing giving to that character. Another clich√© that the amnesia it‚Äôs like almost in every anime and wolverine has that. Positives character moments you get there, father daughter, dynamic, red guardian and Yelena. creative how they show the flashbacks with Sentries powers to get to see in their heads. The messages what makes a hero, facing trauma, facing your demons. Finding your place in the world. Another negative Walker I don‚Äôt get why everyone said they loved him. He‚Äôs a supposedly fan favorite. Cinematography in one scene particular when century is in the prison, they have evil Elaine from Seinfeld is talking to him and he had this great visual on this orange lighting. Some landscape shots are really nice. When Valentina is in the building when you see the pillars in the background as a cool shot. The action there‚Äôs awesome hand to hand combat fighting. The aesthetic is a grimy look similar to the Boys but a PG-13 version. The definite delight of the film, red guardian, funny and brings energy into the film. Yelena Sarcasm and ghost they double teamed, and took down Walker."

Best character was Red Guardian because of the humor and half the time, it wasn‚Äôt even what he said, it was how he said it. Furthermore, the movie felt like an extended promotional advertisement for Fantastic 4. And WHY was the scene of them climbing up that damn wall so long? BORINGGGGGGGGG.

    "review": "Cons: I'd say there was a bit too much forced humor which took away from scenes that were supposed to be intense. Also, I would have liked to see more from Bucky in this movie, and while Yelena is great, Marvel needs to be more careful about which characters they give the most lime-light to. Just because a big name actor plays a character (Florence Pugh), doesn't mean that character has to be the lead (another great example of this was Emilia Clark's G'iah). It hurts to think about how this movie deprived fans of a Bucky-lead film which is what I think everyone was hoping for to an extent. Unfortunately, I don't think Bucky is going to last much longer in the MCU, and I hardly doubt he'll be in another movie that would give him the chance to play that titular character. Again, while Florence Pugh's Yelena was great, that doesn't mean she has to lead a film in which there is another clear character (Bucky) who should have been the lead and deserved to be at this point. Pros: This is definitely one of the best Marvel movies I have seen in a while. It was heartfelt, emotional, and fun. I even found myself crying at one point which has only every happened to me 3 times before while watching a Marvel movie (Avengers: Endgame, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, and Spider-Man: No Way Home). The action was on point, especially towards the third act. Also, the soundtrack was great."

I always enjoy the MCU, and while not all entries can be the best one yet this one leads it all in the right direction. I thoroughly enjoyed almost every moment of this movie. Which is way more then I can say about the previous entry (Brave New World). Nothing here seemed repetitive in story telling and recycled without acknowledgement. Florence Pugh does a fantastic job bringing character and warmth to the what could be cookie cutter material. She digs in without over doing it and delivers her dialogue with great nuance. The rest of the cast is fleshed out beautifully. I was excited to see Wyatt Russell back in the MCU as well as Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost). This unique lineup that was not forced played out beautifully. Some cheeky cliche moments occurred, but you have to sometimes accept that. They weren't bad moments and give you hope for more moments to come. Plus some great nods to previous MCU moments. I appreciated the setting of this back in New York and at the Avengers/Stark/Watchtower. They are leaning into building a history for this site very well! Lewis Pullman has become a new favorite actor of mine and seeing him come into the MCU as the Entry/Void was perfect. The overused trope of Villain within the walls of the story was getting frustrating, but the Sentry story I became very open to. Lewis Pullman may have had a lot to do with that. Not having a formal villain to rid the earth of can often lead to an unsatisfying result (Brave New World) and is best works for Marvel TV shows, not the movies. This time was perfect. It might have been the build up for the future of the MCU and Avengers movies that helped also move this along or inspire greatness, but Ill take it and look very much to seeing this team again. The downfall if you really look at is this is its a repeat of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Just different characters and an updated story. We have our Ultron/Vision arc much repeated here but motives and reasons why things were happening is where things differ. I don't mind this, you don't really notice it unless your like me and really dig into the story. There is only so many reasons for scenarios to exist, its recreating them that becomes the interesting part and Thunderbolts* did so very well. Lastly....ill never get sick of seeing Bucky in the MCU. Sebastian Stan is wonderful and they continue to write him in in such subtly appropriate ways to not exploit his character and for that Im appreciative. Any scenes with Bucky certainly stood out bridging the old and new that creates distinct moments for this long time character of the MCU!"

    "review": "Thunderbolts* ‚Äì A Surprisingly Sharp, Gritty, and Grounded Marvel Entry Thunderbolts* might just be the shot of adrenaline the MCU needed. It trades in the world-ending sky beams and multiverse chaos for something grittier, more personal, and refreshingly human. What I loved most is how the film manages to feel *grounded*‚Äîwhile still delivering the action and spectacle you‚Äôd expect from a Marvel production. The cast absolutely clicks. The chemistry between these morally grey, damaged characters is electric, and it‚Äôs fascinating to watch a team of antiheroes try (and often fail) to work together. It‚Äôs not about perfect heroes saving the day‚Äîit‚Äôs about broken people trying to find redemption in a world that‚Äôs already written them off. Every character is given space to shine‚Äîno one fades into the background. Whether it's Yelena's sharp wit and emotional complexity, Bucky's inner conflict, or Red Guardian's layered mix of humor and regret, the film nails the ensemble dynamic without ever feeling overcrowded. The tone is darker, yes, but never dull. There‚Äôs weight to the decisions, actual consequences to the action, and the tension doesn‚Äôt come from magical MacGuffins‚Äîbut from the characters themselves, their pasts, and their uneasy alliances. It feels like a Marvel movie for grown-ups‚Äîwithout being grim for the sake of it. The action is tight, brutal, and real. There‚Äôs a physicality to it that makes it hit harder than most recent MCU entries. It‚Äôs not just noise‚Äîit‚Äôs storytelling through combat, and it works. In short, Thunderbolts* is bold without being loud, emotionally resonant without being melodramatic, and action-packed without losing sight of its characters. It might not be the flashiest Marvel film, but it‚Äôs one of the most mature, well-balanced, and compelling ones in recent years. Highly recommended‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôve been waiting for Marvel to take a risk that *pays off*"

    "review": "Thunderbolts* aka *The New Avengers was great. I love the characters, the story, the acting everything is well done! The message of the movie is well done! Marvel yet again showcases how their characters are for everyone and can showcase representation for so many dynamics. The Thunderbolts* characters are representation of everyone that could feel that they've failed in life and have a hard time making a life for themselves. There's some of us that spend a lot of time struggling in life and on the wrong side of where we want to be and sometimes find it extremely hard to get our life together. These are our characters to connect to. My personal favorites are definitely Ghost, Yelena, The Sentry and Bucky The White Wolf. We really need to hear the rest of the MCU learn that codename for Bucky besides the Wakandans because it's a really cool codename and The White Wolf is a really cool character."

This movie actually has a heart and soul, meaning, great performances, and relatable characters. The story's structure could have been a bit better, some sequences feel mildly rushed and some characters are unfortunately left on the backburner compared to others, but it was still convincing enough and made sense in the end. I'd love to see more of our ragtag team of misfits in the future!"

The talk about loneliness and pointlessness, and the darkness there tearing us down... The silhouette could be different, but that void and darkness is familiar. Having had coworkers lose the battle against their own Void because the person/people who could have been 'the people that come' in time of need, were too busy. This movie is a reminder that we could all be that new avenger to someone in need."

When I went to see this movie, I wasn‚Äôt waiting for the next Avengers or Iron Man. My expectations were low, and I really just wanted to have a fun time seeing bad guys get beat up. I certainly had those expectations met, but I can‚Äôt help but want more. The themes of trauma and facing depression are appreciated, but the journey of Bob as century along this road seems underdeveloped and rushed at the expense of action set pieces that, while admittedly fun, are derivative of so many Marvel action set pieces that we‚Äôve seen before. I liked this movie. It was a good watch. However, if I likely will never watch it again, only because there are many MCU films that do what this movie does, but better."

Thirty-six movies and counting! The MCU delivers for its fans once again."
