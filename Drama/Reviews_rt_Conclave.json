    "review": "A very brilliant movie which manages to keep you engrossed throughout every minute. The stellar performances makes it very difficult to wholly dislike even the worst characters (does the fact that they're all supposedly holy men help in this regard?) The movie drops many crumbs early on which makes it clear that *something* will happen with x and y, but each one is paid off in very rewarding ways that would be difficult to expect. Cardinal Lawrence, played by Ralph Fiennes, gives what at times seems like an exceedingly amazing performance--it feels like scenes were added just to flex his amazing skills, despite not necessarily adding much to the character or story. I watched this without subtitles, which, with all the language switching that happens with certain characters, makes it somewhat difficult to follow at times. But the acting and delivery and structure of the scenes makes it clear to the watcher at least vaguely what's happening, even if the dialogue is unintelligible. The twist at the end, despite technically being set up, does feel like it came somewhat out of no where, but is rewarded anyways by an excellent performance by [spoiler]. It's a quiet yet thrilling political drama set in a restricted setting, and each action feels just as consequential as the last."

And by the time the film was over, I could understand all the praise I had heard about it. The direction and photography are brilliant; the soundtrack is remarkable; and the cast is incredible, with Ralph Fiennes being a standout. Having watched it after Pope Francis' death and, therefore, before the conclave to elect the new Pope, this film touched me deeply. I simply loved the personalities of each cardinal, and the internal disputes between them: far from being gods, they are normal people, with dilemmas, fears and flaws. The settings are also another highlight, contributing entirely to the immersion in the story. A simple, yet brilliant film."

    "review": "(CASTELLANO) No me esperaba disfrutar tanto Conclave, y al final me ha parecido una de las películas más sólidas del año. Con un guion bien trenzado, un reparto en estado de gracia y una dirección elegante pero efectiva, la historia atrapa desde los primeros minutos y se va construyendo poco a poco, sin prisas, pero con firmeza. Que esté basada en una novela de Robert Harris, autor que sigo desde Patria, se nota: hay profundidad, tensión y giros bien dosificados. Ralph Fiennes está excelente. Su interpretación del camarlengo Thomas Lawrence tiene la medida justa entre contención y emoción. Se mueve entre el deber y la duda con una naturalidad que da peso a cada escena, y sostiene el relato con una sobriedad que no cae nunca en la exageración. Y a su alrededor, todo funciona. Desde el diseño de producción hasta la música, pasando por un grupo de actores secundarios perfectamente escogidos, la película desprende clase. Lo mejor es cómo el suspense no se sacrifica en favor de lo solemne. Berger consigue que la intriga avance como una partida de ajedrez en la que cada movimiento importa, sin perder de vista el contexto espiritual y político del Vaticano. El resultado es un thriller sofisticado y absorbente que, sin necesidad de aspavientos, te mantiene pegado a la pantalla. Un 9 bien merecido. (ENGLISH) I didn’t expect to enjoy Conclave this much, and in the end, it turned out to be one of the most solid films of the year. With a tightly woven script, a cast in top form, and a direction that’s elegant yet effective, the story pulls you in from the first minutes and builds slowly but confidently. The fact that it’s based on a novel by Robert Harris—an author I’ve followed since Fatherland—shows in the depth, tension, and well-timed twists. Ralph Fiennes is excellent. His portrayal of Cardinal Thomas Lawrence hits the perfect balance between restraint and emotion. He moves between duty and doubt with a naturalness that gives every scene weight, and he holds the film together with a calm presence that never slips into overacting. Around him, everything works: from the production design to the music, and a cast of perfectly chosen supporting actors, the film oozes quality. The best part is how it manages to deliver suspense without losing its solemn tone. Berger turns the intrigue into a chess match where every move matters, while never forgetting the spiritual and political context of the Vatican. The result is a sophisticated, absorbing thriller that keeps you hooked without needing to shout. A well-earned 9."

Apesar de que não levo o Oscar com a devida seriedade que a mídia leva, justamente por constantemente cometer erros drásticos como esse: Conclave perder para Anora. Em minha lista pessoal, Conclave é vencedor de melhor filme e ponto. Como descrever a qualidade impecável de um filme tão detalhado como esse? Ele integra a \"lista\" de filmes, que ao terminar, posso dizer que gastei meu tempo com maestria. Filme que prende a sua atenção do início ao fim. O enredo que mistura as liturgias católicas com política, pondo em cheque o caráter dos cardeais na decisão difícil de escolher aquele que seria o Papa, ou seja, o representante maior de Deus na terra. O filme se torna ainda mais interessante pelo fato de abordar um tema sigiloso, como o Conclave, já que só quem participa da eleição, sabe realmente o que acontece lá. Excelente escolha de tema. O final, encerra a história com chave de ouro. A escolha do nome do Papa eleito, e a história de vida dele, narrada em minutos, encerra com chave de ouro todo o enredo do filme. Ninguém poderia imaginar esse filme! Eu não imaginei esse filme! Que filme! Recomendo demais!"

That said Conclave somehow inspired me to think that maybe, 1,000 years from now, there might be a delightful future where humans can accept each other as humans.

The villan was merely a conservative and every candidate was simply flawed, so the church elects a hermaphrodite and covers it up? I guess that is Hollywood's ideal Catholic Church."

    "review": "Conclave had all the makings of a great film — a stellar cast, strong cinematography, and a fascinating premise — but unfortunately, it didn’t quite deliver a satisfying experience from start to finish. While the acting was superb (Ralph Fiennes and John Lithgow were easily the highlights, delivering layered, memorable performances), the film’s structure left a lot to be desired. Over the course of two hours, Conclave introduced more questions than it answered, creating plot holes that were never fully addressed. Important storylines seemed to fizzle out, and some conclusions felt more like abrupt stops than true endings. It’s clear there was a lot of potential here, and at times, the film showed flashes of brilliance. But ultimately, the lack of narrative payoff made it feel incomplete — like a beautifully set table with half the meal missing. Fans of Fiennes and Lithgow will still find something to appreciate, but Conclave falls short of being the thoughtful, gripping drama it could have been."

Or the sudden revelation that the Pope was murdered, shattering expectations and throwing the Vatican into chaos. Maybe Benitez, chosen as Pope, turns out to be an imposter, forcing Lawrence into an impossible moral dilemma—does he expose the deception or safeguard the Church from further scandal?

A subtle and tasteful film which views the world and its current state through the lens of Catholicism. The acting is brilliant, particularly Ralph Fiennes and Sergio Castellito. The filming and camera work is great too - the austerity of the cardinals’ lodgings and the buzzing hallway seems at odds with what we would expect for such lofty individuals. Rich in motifs too - the laboured breathing of Fienne’s reluctant character keeps coming back. Just when I thought every mainstream film was absolute shite, this restored my faith.

The film touches the surface of minor Politics involved in the decision for the next Holy Father, the dynamics of the conclave, all while following Cardinal Lawrence, his struggles with the Church, and his dedication to God. Heavy on drama, the story is slow-paced like a Conclave itself. The glimpses we get of the rites that happen during this period are cool for a particular audience, but the runtime might be a detractor for those who couldn’t care less. Though strong on its execution and great on the visuals, Conclave fails to shine a light onto the deeper aspects of a real conclave. The film shows little of the discussions and party rallies, and the major mystery is dismissed for much of the runway, swapped for a minor one that is easy to solve. When the major mystery comes back for the final revelation, the shocking it is supposed to entail is quickly wrapped up with an ending that leaves things too open. Conclave entertains those that have some sort of religious interest or belief, especially Catholics and close variants. Anyone that dismisses religion or really just can’t stand it, well, won’t stand this story either."

    "review": "Upon the pope’s death, cardinal Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) by virtue of position as dean, forms a conclave where cardinals are sequestered in the Vatican City, free from outside influence and submerged in secrecy to vote for a new pope. Ralph Fiennes succeeds in evoking a reluctant, worried but determined manager, a shepherd herding a flock of considerably, some of the most powerful men in the world. These men whisper and subtly malign their contemporaries’ chances of getting voted into the papacy. On top of this, cardinal Lawrence deals with a crisis of faith, initially resolved not to listen to matters about backgrounds that may describe a candidate as unworthy, but his own morality defies this rule – learning of past scandals and leading to revelations and disqualifications. On the other hand, this leads to him also becoming a suitable candidate by his peers, earning votes he claims he does not desire, earning both judgement and support. The film hints on the ongoing symptoms of institutions that abuse power and tolerates prejudice, championed by those who lead them. And some of this are embedded in laws that entail breaking to do what is right. The cardinals are framed not as caricatures of agendas but people of converging and contrasting beliefs. There are also no purely antagonistic forces but merely the clash of views leading to conflict. Far into the film, the audience is reminded of the power and influence this group of people hold as a bomb tears a hole into the church ceilings, fortunately failing to injure the cardinals. By the end, after a joust of words, the final voting sets a winner, with a twist reveal that tiptoes close to fiction yet not entirely impossible. Depending on audience belief, we are left to play out the remainder of the outcome, but are as relieved as cardinal Lawrence that the conclave is over."

I watched this film with my parents, and we all agreed that it was phenomenal. One thing i must say though, which doesn't mean it's bad, but the character's names and the characters itself give to make an intricate game of \"Who is Who\". We had a bit of a difficult time corresponding each name with with its face. One of the best things, in my opinion, (apart from Ralph Fiennes and Stanley Tucci, who also did an amazing depiction of his character) may be the end.

    "review": "There’s a kind of hush in Conclave—not silence, but the coiled, breath-held quiet of ancient ritual dressed in modern cutlery. It hums beneath cassocks and gritted teeth, beneath the Sistine ceiling that feels less like heaven and more like surveillance. This is a thriller measured in eye flickers and murmured allegiance, where every footstep echoes like a gavel against the ribs of God Himself. The film dares to strip theology of majesty and expose its scaffolding—fragile men with trembling hands attempting to steer the eternal. It is not about faith; it’s about the performance of belief, a kind of ecclesiastical LARP in the Vatican's bowels, where politics and power pirouette around a slowly dying candle. Fiennes walks like a man who’s been hollowed out by too many whispered truths. His performance isn’t acting, it’s a slow possession. You watch him dissolve into robes and ritual, until only guilt remains—dense and invisible as incense. His eyes do most of the speaking, which feels apt in a film where words are dangerous currency. But what I loved—what made this film throb with relevance—was how it made the divine feel mundane, and the mundane feel profound. A key in a drawer has the tension of a loaded gun. A hallway becomes a confession. And when secrets slip through cracks, they don’t fall—they metastasize. The final reveal is less twist and more transubstantiation. A quiet heresy buried in cloth and dust. And it asks—not whether men can speak for God—but whether they've just been speaking to themselves, in a cathedral-sized echo chamber."

Of course, no movie about the church can sincerely ignore the matter of institutional abuse without losing credibility, however Conclave deals with these matters masterfully. Truthfully, this is a great story about thievery, deception, bribery, diplomacy, and blackmail, as warring factions of the church battle to take over as its leader, and, somewhat predictably, there comes a saviour to unite them all, and preach a message of peace and tolerance. Where have I heard that before? Totally worth a watch, and not as dreary or as gruesome as you might expect a movie about the catholic church to be."

The point of it is also sharply made and the criticism acidic. As a thriller it stands up very well on its own. The wardrobe work is excellent and the detailing on the robes is all impressively correct. The sets and location work are also both just so credible and really enforce the quality of this film. I have to say that I found the art direction caused the view to be a little too dark but I guess that added to the atmoshpere of the story. And a top class cast. Fiennes and Tucci are both supremely good. With such a cast, great producton values being so well shot, this film is a must."

Yes, great actors, beautifully shot, but I had no draw for the characters (except Fiennes) and the story was trite and painfully predictable - I’m usually pretty bad at guessing where a film is going but this plot set up was the most obvious I’ve ever seen. And the ‘twist’ was so trivial and undeveloped, it was meant to be a bombshell but they watered down the concept so much it ended up being utterly pointless. They could have skipped the seven rounds of drama free voting and jumped to the consequences of the final decision in the first 20 minutes and begun a meaningful story that actually confronted the themes it suggested to raise. I expected so much more from this movie, a huge disappointment for me."

In addition to that, the synopsis kinda oversold this as it was what finally convinced me to give this a shot. A conclave and the politicking to choose the next pope with various demographics as catalysts isn’t exactly the ‘uncovering of deep secrets that could shake the Roman Catholic Church to it’s foundation’ that I was expecting. Not to mention, it takes nearly 80 minutes for it to get to the crux of the matter and that wasn’t enough to win back my undivided attention once it did. For people interested in a fictitous account of the process that does at least appear to make a sincere effort to be as respectful as possible, it may hit the right notes. It seemed accurate, seemed well made, seemed enlightening but... baits too much with divisive issues."

    "review": "Edward Berger's film following the drama and intrigue of the secretive process of the Papal Conclave - the sequestered meeting in which a new pope is elected - is a masterclass in adaptation. Taking Robert Harris's novel as its source, what could have been claustrophobic becomes intimate and what could have been tortuous becomes suffused with low-key but no less gripping tension. Beautifully written and shot, it seems at first glance to be a long way from the director's previous film, his excellent take on All Quiet On The Western Front. But there are connections - both films are concerned with the machinery of their subject matter. War in the first instance, church politics. In both cases there is a different kind of tragedy showing starkly how human beings become part of that machinery - trying to do good, sucked up into the business of which they are a part, principles and humanity constantly up for debate as compromises are made, broken and remade. Both films focus on groups made up almost entirely of men - but certainly in Conclave, the role of women is cleverly noted - and when one woman intervenes it is economic and powerful. Brilliantly cast, there's some superbly subtle acting - especially in the way different performers employ there faces, reacting to what they see, hear or communicating wordlessly what they think and feel. The film's revelatory twist could have been tacky in other hands - but the film having built up an effective atmosphere of secrecy and claustrophobia, shutting out the outside the world, it works brilliantly. In my screening there were audible gasps and brief gaggle of excited chattering at the revelation. It's refreshing also that a piece of art can be clear about its criticisms of faith and the church specifically but still understand the importance of the role these things play in people's lives. Spirituality is understood, not patronised - which makes its critiques all the more powerful and its characters all the more humane. A superb, intelligent, gracious political thriller that will provoke as much thought as it grips and surprises."

I would classify the movie as a drama, not as either a thriller or a mystery. Disappointed only in that I thought they could have done more with the ending given the great setup. And yes I do realize the movie was based on the book, so these things were largely out of their control, but the feelings remain."

The spoiler free summaries lead you to believe that there's a more in-depth corruption scandal than there is, when it's minor and simple corruption, not relating to criminal behaviour. There are some heretical concepts pushed as normal and accepted concepts, which are not biblically sound, and it seems quite clear to me that it was done to push certain ideological viewpoints, so if you're looking to watch the movie from any sort of accuracy or educational standpoint, then you won't find that here. The ending plot twist was so absurd and out of pocket that I couldn't even be annoyed at it, it actually made me physically laugh, despite the intended tone of the scene. The only reason I wouldn't give it lower is because the cinematography is actually decent. So if you don't care about slower pacing, accuracy of the portrayal of Christian beliefs, and don't go in expecting that there's an in-depth criminal corruption scandal, then you may find the movie to be a 6 instead of a 3."

I have to say that the work of recreating the Sistine Chapel was incredible, the details… in short, a good film with good acting and good direction. This film certainly deserved to win several Oscars, especially Best Picture, but in the hearts of the audience, Conclave will be the moral winner. What a wonderful experience it was to watch this film. At the end, I confess that I was shocked by what was revealed to the audience, but in a good way because they managed to include a great plot twist.

Someone needs to tell Edward Berger to chill, man, lol. This man is swiftly becoming one of the most impressive filmmakers working today and it's by no small margin. To pivot from the sobering, almost apocalyptic feelings brought about by \"All Quiet On The Western Front\" to the more cerebral and world-affirming stylings of \"Conclave\" is one thing -- but to make both feel as consequential and as thematically cathartic as the other (two completely different movies!) is just amazing talent at work. Impeccable acting here, too. Ralph Fiennes carries the weight of this on his whole frame and he deserves every award he's been nominated for, in my opinion. Though, everyone does such a damn good job in this, you could freakin' blink and surely miss a great performance from a background actor or something. A collection of objectively thought-provoking ethical case studies, strung together with brilliant storytelling, set against the backdrop of organized religion. . .AND it doesn't ultimately feel condescending to any particular group of people? One of the best films of this past year, hands down."

Stanley Tucci sounded exactly like he did on his “Searching for Italy” series, Isabella Rossellini gets too few lines of dialogue and John Lithgow could have had better lines.

In 4K, this film is gorgeous. I'm glad this film received a BP nomination. \"Anora\" seems to be a lock with the oddsmakers but if this one sneaks through, I would not be surprised.

Watching the excellent actor Ralph Fiennes lead the election of the pope shows that it is not an easy choice and that it has great weight for all Catholic Church faithful around the world. However, it ends up coming up against the personal dilemmas of each candidate and shows how human beings put their own interests first. At first, it may seem like a criticism of the Catholic Church, but on the contrary, it wants to show that, despite the adversities, the church remains firm and its ideals intact. It is not a film with a surprising and action-packed story, but it keeps the audience's expectations high with each vote. Rooting for Ralph Fiennes' character becomes the easiest path, but the film gives us an ending that is above that."

And there is an almost palpable sense of the pressure and the power game that occurs during the conclave. The unfolding, the stories that are told, the signs that appear throughout the film and the anguish over every vote that happens and is not concluded, generate that anxiety and add depth to the film, attracting the audience even more to the narrative."

Ralph Finnes drives the conclave to elect a Pope with stunning meticulous detail. And challenges to his work abound and surprises never cease. Stanley Tucci provides what Stanley Tucci normally provides in front of the camera. Fine acting with a tinge of sarcasm and humility. The directing is stupendous and the art direction and set design gives you a sense of slight claustrophobia. This only heightens the experience."

    "review": "Despite an impressive cast featuring John Lithgow, Ralph Fiennes, and Stanley Tucci, Conclave is an incredibly slow and tedious film that struggles to maintain engagement. What should have been a tense and gripping political thriller instead drags its feet with long-winded dialogues and an overindulgence in atmosphere rather than substance. The film sets up an intriguing premise—the secretive election of a new pope following the unexpected death of his predecessor—but fails to capitalize on its potential. Instead of tension and suspense, we get a plodding narrative that never truly takes off. The performances are solid, as expected from such seasoned actors, but even their talents aren’t enough to breathe life into the sluggish pacing. And then there’s the ending—an absolute anticlimax. After enduring nearly two hours of slow buildup, the payoff is underwhelming and unsatisfying, leaving the viewer with a sense of wasted time rather than thought-provoking resolution. Conclave had all the ingredients for a gripping political drama but ultimately fails to deliver. Even with a stellar cast, the film is a test of patience rather than a rewarding cinematic experience."

    "review": "It is essential to clarify that the movie Conclave is NOT a faithful representation of reality; rather, it is a work of fiction based on a novel, with invented characters designed to create a dramatic thriller. Due to its serious and detailed tone, along with the lack of explicit clarifications regarding its fictional nature, the film can contribute to misinformation if viewers believe it accurately reflects how the Church operates. Conclave presents a distorted view of the Church and the Vatican as a place of dark secrets and conspiracies, diverging from its true function as the spiritual and administrative center of the Catholic Church. Cardinals are portrayed as excessively ambitious figures, focused on power struggles and morally questionable behavior, reinforcing a stereotypical and negative image of the clergy. Let’s clarify some points depicted in the film: The conclave process is not merely an electoral event but a profoundly spiritual occasion. Cardinals seek to discern God’s will through prayer, reflection, and deliberation. Certain plot elements contradict official Church teachings and established practices, which may lead to confusion. Some viewers might mistakenly believe that the Church is open to elections or practices that are currently not possible under its doctrine. The film portrays the conclave as an event where extraordinary situations can easily occur, whereas in reality, it is strictly regulated by detailed norms and traditions rooted in deep reforms. The audience may interpret that the Catholic Church is more divided, disorganized, or flexible in its doctrines than it actually is, reinforcing misconceptions and stereotypes. The movie presents a one-sided and overly pessimistic view of the Church, ignoring the many examples of service, charity, and holiness that exist in reality. It is important to distinguish between the fictional elements of the film and the real principles that govern the Catholic Church. While Conclave presents an intriguing scenario from a narrative perspective, it significantly deviates from doctrinal reality and the practical criteria that guide the Church’s leadership."

The film pulls you straight into the Vatican, with stunningly authentic sets that make you feel like you're actually there. The dialogue crackles with intelligence, every exchange layered with intrigue, power struggles, and hidden motives. And that soundtrack—subtle yet haunting—perfectly underscores the weight of every whispered conversation. Just when you think you know where it’s going, the film throws in a twist that keeps you hooked. It’s no surprise this one’s racking up Oscar nominations. *Conclave* is proof that pure storytelling, when done right, can be just as thrilling as any action-packed blockbuster. A well-earned four stars."

    "review": "“Conclave,” directed by Edward Berger and released on October 25, 2024, offers a behind-the-scenes look at the secretive process of electing a new pope following the sudden death of the incumbent. The film boasts a stellar cast, including Ralph Fiennes as Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, Stanley Tucci as Cardinal Bellini, and John Lithgow as Cardinal Tremblay. ￼ The narrative centers on Cardinal Lawrence, who is tasked with overseeing the conclave. As the cardinals gather, political maneuvering and personal ambitions come to the forefront, revealing a web of intrigue within the Vatican’s hallowed halls. The film delves into themes of faith, power, and the complexities of religious leadership. The musical score by Volker Bertelmann and the cinematography by Stéphane Fontaine are standout elements, creating a visually stunning and sonically rich experience. However, there are moments where the dramatic emphasis in the score and visuals seems to surpass the narrative’s intensity, potentially overshadowing the story’s subtler aspects. Performances by Fiennes and Tucci are commendable, bringing depth and nuance to their roles. Despite the film’s buildup, the anticipated intense scandal culminates in a reveal that serves more as a commentary on contemporary political conservatism than a dramatic climax. While “Conclave” has garnered critical attention, it may owe some of its prominence to a relatively subdued year in cinema. Overall, “Conclave” is a thought-provoking film that offers insight into the clandestine world of papal elections, bolstered by strong performances and exceptional technical elements. However, its narrative choices may leave some viewers desiring a more impactful resolution."

It feels like a story that could take place in business meeting, but behind the vail of the Catholic Churches process to pick the next Pope adds a fascinating level of intrigue and makes the films twists much more satisfying. The locations looks beautiful and realistic. I know the filmed in and around Rome, but at times I felt like they were deep inside the Vatican. Very impressive. I also really enjoyed the bouncing back between English and Italian, it added another level of realism. Acting standouts: The cast is tight from top to bottom. Isabella Rossellini was a fantastic choice and she brought such weight to her role. Can't wait to watch it again."

The director wants YOU to be part of the tedious process of picking a papal leader. People in the US are used to loud and fast with elections and are dumbfounded that some choose leaders with thought and consideration. Which, in turn, makes it look boring. Additionally, the ending is a perfect encapsulation of what is threatening our culture: Certainty."

The cast is an amazing group of actors lead by Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, and Isabella Rossellini to name a few. The music adds a great touch that just enhances all of the drama.

    "review": "With strong visuals and excellent performances, this film stands out as a meticulously crafted drama. The cast is superb, with Ralph Fiennes (outstanding), Stanley Tucci, and John Lithgow delivering layered, compelling performances. Isabella Rossellini, one of the few female figures in the film, brings her signature presence—mysterious, poised, and full of depth. Director Edward Berger demonstrates outstanding craftsmanship, proving once again that he understands how to shape both characters and audience emotions with precision. He skillfully manipulates tension and intrigue, making for an immersive experience. The film’s depiction of the Vatican’s inner world is fascinating, offering an insightful look into the highly exclusive and enigmatic world of the vatican. The story and script adaptation are masterfully crafted, maintaining depth and intrigue throughout—until the final moments. Unfortunately, the revelation of the new pope’s “secret” feels unnecessary and contrived, seemingly added to align with a contemporary political or cultural agenda rather than serving the film’s organic narrative. The inner conflict of the lead character (Ralph Fiennes) is already profoundly evident and beautifully developed, making this late twist feel artificial and redundant rather than enhancing the story. Of course you can add a \"surprise\" and deliver a message you think it is worth to be told, but in this case it was simply too much on the nose. Instead of deepening the film’s impact, it disrupts the carefully constructed world and risks undermining its resonance on the international stage. All at all, a visually stunning, exceptionally well-acted film with a gripping narrative and outstanding direction. Were it not for the forced final revelation, it could have been a true modern classic. Still, a must-watch for those who appreciate intelligent, atmospheric storytelling and superb performances."

    "review": "Conclave, dirigido por Edward Berger, chega com a promessa de ser um drama sofisticado e intrigante, seguindo os passos do aclamado Nada de Novo no Front, que rendeu ao diretor um Oscar de Melhor Filme Internacional em 2023. Trazendo novamente um orçamento de 20 milhões de dólares, Berger se propôs a explorar um dos processos mais sigilosos e fascinantes do mundo: a escolha do novo Papa, durante o tradicional conclave do Vaticano. Com um elenco estelar liderado por Ralph Fiennes e Stanley Tucci, além de uma equipe técnica afiada, o filme parecia destinado a ocupar um lugar de destaque na temporada de premiações. Mas, como tantas produções com alta expectativa, Conclave tropeça em sua própria ambição ao não sustentar o impacto emocional e narrativo que promete. Desde o início, Conclave impressiona por seu design de produção meticuloso e pela recriação detalhada do processo de seleção papal. A equipe de Berger realizou uma pesquisa profunda para traduzir o sigilo e a grandiosidade do conclave em tela. Cada detalhe do ambiente, desde os figurinos dos cardeais até os cenários claustrofóbicos da Capela Sistina, contribui para uma atmosfera de isolamento que se torna quase palpável. Berger utiliza o espaço para amplificar a tensão e o mistério, enquanto o design de arte, impecável em sua execução, confere um realismo que enriquece a experiência do espectador. Essa ambientação cuidadosamente elaborada é um dos maiores trunfos do filme e, sem dúvida, será lembrada nas categorias técnicas das premiações. No centro da narrativa está Ralph Fiennes, interpretando o cardeal responsável por organizar o conclave. Com uma performance que equilibra fragilidade emocional e autoridade moral, Fiennes entrega um trabalho digno de destaque. Seu personagem, inicialmente um mero facilitador do processo, se vê imerso em uma teia de segredos, mentiras e dilemas pessoais. A dinâmica entre os cardeais, representados por um elenco diversificado e talentoso, é outro ponto alto do filme. Stanley Tucci, em particular, brilha em suas aparições, trazendo nuances e complexidade ao seu papel. A trama é construída de forma a manter o público intrigado com os mistérios por trás de cada cardeal, suas alianças políticas e convicções morais, que oscilam entre visões conservadoras e liberais. Berger demonstra habilidade ao manter o público imerso nesse ambiente denso e repleto de tensão durante a primeira metade do filme. Cada cena é carregada de simbolismos e camadas de significado, enquanto os diálogos revelam pedaços importantes da narrativa. A sensação de suspense é cuidadosamente orquestrada, e a trama parece caminhar para um clímax arrebatador. No entanto, o que começa como uma obra intrigante e cheia de potencial, logo se revela previsível e formulaica. O maior problema de Conclave reside em sua estrutura narrativa. Na metade do filme, praticamente todos os mistérios e segredos apresentados são resolvidos, esvaziando o suspense que sustentava a história até então. O foco retorna à escolha do novo Papa, que deveria ser o ponto central do longa, mas perde força devido à previsibilidade do desfecho. Embora o roteiro tente introduzir um novo plot twist nos minutos finais, ele surge tarde demais e carece de desenvolvimento para causar o impacto desejado. A transição entre a resolução dos mistérios e a retomada da narrativa principal é abrupta e dilui o envolvimento emocional do espectador. Além disso, Conclave desperdiça a oportunidade de aprofundar questões morais e políticas que poderiam enriquecer a trama. O embate entre as visões conservadoras e liberais dos cardeais é apenas superficialmente explorado, sem que o filme se comprometa a desenvolver um debate mais profundo sobre o impacto dessas escolhas. O roteiro se contenta em pincelar essas questões, deixando de lado a complexidade que o tema merece. No entanto, nem tudo se perde. A direção de Berger continua sólida, e sua habilidade em criar atmosferas tensas é inegável. A trilha sonora e a fotografia complementam a ambientação, contribuindo para uma experiência visual e sensorial envolvente. O elenco, liderado por Fiennes e Tucci, eleva o material que tem em mãos, trazendo camadas de profundidade mesmo quando o roteiro falha em explorá-las. Em resumo, Conclave é um filme tecnicamente impressionante, com atuações marcantes e uma premissa fascinante. No entanto, sua incapacidade de sustentar o mistério e a tensão até o final, combinada com a superficialidade na exploração de temas morais, impede que a obra atinja todo o seu potencial. Berger demonstra novamente seu talento para construir narrativas grandiosas, mas aqui, a execução fica aquém das expectativas. Ainda assim, Conclave é uma experiência que vale a pena pela sua atmosfera imersiva e pelas performances de seu elenco, mesmo que a previsibilidade do roteiro deixe um sabor agridoce."

Conclave is defined as a tense and satisfying drama, where individual interests and aspirations clash. It is a hilarious representation of power struggles, the meaning of truth and the relevance of certainties and doubts. However, in practical terms, it is a film that can be considered mostly forgettable. Conclave is more than a war of egos and ambitions. We are faced with a cinematographic work that is solid, serious, intelligent and visually attractive, but which is supported mainly by the performances, which are generally first class (a special mention for Isabella Rossellini) and by the surprising twists of the story, which are developed with intelligent and fun creativity. An ecclesiastical script, incredibly sharp, unexpected and with a message as risky as it is pertinent."

Loved the great actors in play especially my old favourite John Lightgow from originally I remember him the main actor in Third Rock from the Sun then in Dexter as The Trinity killer. Now here he shows us all that is truely brilliant. I watched it with my daughter and when I saw them all gathered there I said to her why is there no women here? Wouldn’t it be funny if the new pope be a woman? Well, I only started thinking this way because our new world of acceptance is now in a full swing. Well, without giving too much of the ending for those who hasn’t seen it yet all I saw was the lack of scenes. It was all made inside the church nothing showing much outside it. Seemed like they saved money for the great actors play instead. Very disappointing there and to me the ending as well."

    "review": "Conclave (2023), directed by Edward Berger and featuring an ensemble cast led by Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, and John Lithgow, is a gripping political thriller that immerses viewers in the secretive world of the Catholic Church. Based on Robert Harris’s novel, the film unfolds within the confines of the Sistine Chapel as a conclave of cardinals gathers to elect a new pope following the sudden death of the previous pontiff. Amidst the solemn rituals and cloaked traditions, personal rivalries and explosive secrets threaten to unravel the sanctity of the process. From the outset, Berger establishes a meticulously crafted atmosphere of tension and reverence. The first half of the film sets a deliberate pace, immersing the audience in the intricacies of the conclave and the subtle power plays between the cardinals. Fiennes delivers a masterclass in restraint as Cardinal Lomeli, the protagonist whose quiet demeanor belies a sharp intellect and moral resolve. The interplay between Fiennes and Tucci, portraying the cunning Cardinal Bellini, brims with understated intensity, while Lithgow’s Cardinal Tremblay injects a measure of gravitas and ambiguity into his performance. Berger’s direction shines in the film’s visual and auditory details. The cinematography by James Friend captures the grandeur and intimacy of the Vatican with equal finesse, utilizing soft lighting and rich textures to convey both the beauty of the setting and the weight of the decisions being made. Volker Bertelmann’s score underscores the narrative’s solemnity while subtly amplifying moments of suspense and revelation. The film’s editing complements its structure, allowing the tension to build methodically in the first half before propelling viewers into a more fast-paced and unpredictable second act. The screenplay, adapted by Harris himself, strikes a balance between theological discourse and human drama. The script avoids overwhelming viewers with jargon, instead focusing on the universal themes of power, faith, and redemption. The dialogues crackle with intelligence, particularly during heated debates between the cardinals, which expose the ideological divides within the Church. However, the narrative occasionally falters when it leans too heavily on exposition, particularly in the slower moments of the first act, which may test the patience of some viewers. The film’s second half takes an unexpected turn, shifting from a contemplative exploration of faith and duty into a high-stakes game of political intrigue. This dynamic shift is handled deftly, as Berger ramps up the tension and delivers a series of revelations that challenge the audience’s perceptions of the characters. The climactic moments are both shocking and thematically resonant, tying together the personal and political threads in a satisfying manner. One of the film’s greatest strengths lies in its ability to probe weighty questions without providing easy answers. It examines the tension between tradition and progress, as well as the fragility of human morality in the face of power. Comparisons to other ecclesiastical dramas like The Two Popes are inevitable, but where that film leaned on warmth and humor, Conclave opts for a darker, more introspective tone. Berger’s approach also recalls the taut storytelling of his earlier work in All Quiet on the Western Front, showcasing his knack for blending character-driven drama with broader thematic concerns. As awards season approaches, Conclave is generating considerable Oscar buzz, particularly for Fiennes’s nuanced performance and Berger’s assured direction. The film’s technical achievements, including its production design and score, are also strong contenders for recognition. While it may not appeal to audiences seeking fast-paced entertainment, those with an appreciation for intelligent, character-driven narratives will find much to admire in this meticulously crafted drama. Overall, Conclave earns four stars for its compelling performances, thoughtful storytelling, and striking visuals. It is a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, inviting reflection on the complexities of faith, leadership, and the human condition. Whether you’re drawn to the intrigue of its premise or the depth of its themes, this is a cinematic experience well worth seeking out."

A masterful and gripping film executed with the utmost care, with a career-defining performance by Ralph Fiennes imbued with depth and gravitas, a spellbinding cinematography that captures the grandeur and solemnity of the Vatican, a compelling screenplay full of surprising plot twists throughout until the very end, and an inspiring score composed by Volker Bertelmann. It is also reportedly a very accurate adaptation of the book it is based on, which should be an easy feat, given the straightforward development of the story. With its timely exploration of religion and controversial themes, this film is poised to join the ranks of the most relevant and thought-provoking dramas of our era.

That was excellent because it was intriguing, but also offered a lot of emotion from his co-stars as they react to the situation they are in. Also has some surprising things sprinkled throughout to make it slightly elevated. I really, really liked this film. Thank you!"

    "review": "One of the first films of 2024 that I heard attracting awards buzz as the year drew to a close, Conclave demonstrates that films about somewhat mundane subject matter can be elevated with smart writing, excellent performances and a story that carefully meters out its information to keep you interested. Unlike something like Lincoln, where the script is so verbose you fell like you’re being beaten over the head with dialogue, in Conclave its much more pared back. Characters look like they’re actually considering what’s being said to them, and what they’re about to say in response. Ralph Fiennes plays a Cardinal whose careful and considered approach sees him earn the respect of many of his peers, but also the scorn of others, much like how the papal candidates differing points of view makes the voting process so unpredictable. One thing I really appreciate the film for its visual style. It would be so easy for a film of this subject matter to look flat and dull, but much has been done to give it flair and panache. A simple scene of Cardinals walking across a forecourt is rendered striking and memorable with the use of umbrellas and a high angle. Edward Berger is the same man who directed the excellent 2022 version of All Quiet on the Western Front, and this is another great addition to his filmography: Serious in subject matter but entertaining and accessible every step of the way."

But the plot comes undone right at the end, defying convention and common sense to present a contrived and unnecessary twist. I would have been satisfied with what was solid, if unremarkable, fare absent this finale. But here we are. Ultimately, this is the only sort of story that Hollywood can abide about the Catholic Church. Which would all be fine, and might indeed make for an entertaining story, if it had been handled with care and wasn't so manufactured and bluntly 'on message'."

EXCELLENT acting from interesting actors that haven't been overused, and a script that keeps you in suspense without any predictability. Definitely a movie that stands out in the age of streaming!"

    "review": "Last years, “All Quiet on the Western Front” convinced me that Edward Berger was a brilliant director. “Conclave” is another exceptional film. The mise en scene couldn’t be better. Everything in front of the camera from the cold marble walls to the minimalist dining room and the Sistine Chapel with a red interior which blends with the cardinals garments indicates uniformity to me. People who must conform and are not to have secrets. That any one who has erred will be expelled. As the film moves on Humility gives way to political ambitions which creates the intrigue. Cardinal Lawrence, played quietly and reverently by Ralph Fiennes is on the move. He is the guide that takes the viewer from space to space. Sister Agnes is played sternly and directly by Isabella Rossilini. A women’s place is servile to the men. Yet, Rossilini has so much presence and strength in the role. Another triumph for Berger!"

    "review": "“Conclave” is a masterfully crafted thriller that delves into the clandestine world of the Vatican, offering viewers a gripping portrayal of the papal election process. Directed by Edward Berger and based on Robert Harris’s 2016 novel, the film boasts a stellar ensemble cast, including Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, and Isabella Rossellini. The narrative centers on Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes), who is tasked with organizing a conclave to elect a new pope following the sudden death of the pontiff. As the cardinals convene, the film meticulously unravels the intricate political maneuvers, personal ambitions, and deep-seated secrets that influence the election process. Fiennes delivers a nuanced performance, capturing Cardinal Lawrence’s internal conflicts and moral dilemmas with remarkable depth. His portrayal has been lauded as “Oscar-worthy,” with critics highlighting his ability to convey the character’s complexity and torment. ￼ Stanley Tucci’s portrayal of Cardinal Aldo Bellini adds another layer of intrigue, with his character’s motivations and actions keeping audiences on edge. The film’s tension is further amplified by Volker Bertelmann’s evocative score, which complements the suspenseful atmosphere and the high-stakes environment of the conclave. ￼ Critics have praised “Conclave” for its intelligent screenplay by Peter Straughan, which balances the solemnity of the Vatican’s traditions with the human flaws of its characters. The film’s production design and cinematography are equally commendable, capturing the grandeur and secrecy of the Vatican with stunning visuals. The meticulous attention to detail immerses viewers in the sacred rituals and the opulent yet austere settings of the papal enclave. While the film delves into serious themes, it also offers moments of sharp dialogue and subtle humor, reflecting the complexities and contradictions within the Church’s hierarchy. The plot unfolds with deliberate pacing, leading to a climax that is both unexpected and thought-provoking, prompting viewers to reflect on the nature of faith, power, and human frailty. “Conclave” is not just a film about religion; it’s a compelling exploration of the intersection between faith and politics, tradition and change. Its timely release and the themes it tackles resonate with contemporary discussions about institutional power and personal belief. For those seeking a film that combines suspense, stellar performances, and profound thematic depth, “Conclave” is a must-watch."

Doch einige Kandidaten, versuchen mit verschiedensten Mitteln die Wahl zu gewinnen. Und viele haben Leichen im Keller und Kardinal Lawrence versucht diese herauszufinden. Die Frage ist, wer wird Papst. Edward Berger hat hier Regie geführt. Dieser hatte schon mehrere Oscars bekommen für den Film Im Westen nichts Neues. Hiermit zeigt er, dass er ein guter Regisseur ist. Konklave muss ein Oscar Kandidat werden. Unter anderem die Kostüme, das Drehbuch und Ralph Fiennes muss endlich seinen längst verdienten Oscar bekommen. Man glatt glauben, dass dieser Film eine Doku ist, weil alle überragend spielen, aber vor allem Ralph Fiennes. Der Film ist ein Thriller und ist spannend erzählt. Die Traditionen werden hier gut gezeigt, wie es abläuft, wenn der Papst stirbt. Ebenfalls die traditionelle Kleidung ist hervorzuheben. Konklave lägt sehr auf Dialoge und wer Filme nicht mag, wenn zuviel geredet wird, kann mit dem Film nichts anfangen. Man muss auch nicht gläubig sein, um den Film zu verstehen oder zu mögen. Es wird bestimmt eine bestimmte Gruppe geben, die den Film hassen werden. Dazu zählen Leute die andere Religionen oder Vielfalt nicht tolerieren. Konklave ist ein sehr guter Thriller der mit guten Dialogen glänzen kann. Könnte ein Film werden der mindestens 5 Oscarnominierungen bekommen wird. 9/10"

The \"what if\" that designs the story is kind of inconsequential: its development arrives literally one minute from the end of the movie so that is almost an afterthought, and it has pretty much no effect on the story, the background and the personal struggle of the character. In the end, it's just a bunch of reciprocal backstabbing of angry priests that ends in the most obvious way a story of backstabbing priests will end. I think that it's a good movie, but more for the acting and ability to build tension than its overall arcs, plot, and final conclusion."

It seems that they will never tire of making movies with “the message” even when they preform so poorly nowadays. The “surprise twist” is something that you wouldn’t have even guessed four years ago and I guess it has the element of surprise but not of reality. I am neither far right nor far left and I prefer movies that look at things from a socially unbiased perspective and if you are at all like me this movie is not for you. It also makes me wonder how this movie and some others have gotten so favorably scored especially when I’m sure this movie is not properly represented when it comes to the audience.

The slow burn created by the rise and fall of different favorites keeps the audience engaged until the end. If there is a weakness, it lies in the script. While generally solid, it is rather predictable and the downfall of rival candidates too easily achieved. The ending, while satisfying, strains believability. Judge this yourself when you see this otherwise excellent film."

Pretend that it could be acceptable for a person born with two reproductive organs be a pop, its a fantasy and honestly it is an insult for the catholic church. it’s not a movie that should deserve any Oscar for touching that subject . Catholics only recognize man and woman as their legitimate leaders. It’s disrespectful to portrait anything different . Waste of actors , my time and it’s an insult to many Catholics ……"

Sadly, the plot is very thin - everything is an opportunity to criticize the Church (how original). God is strangely absent from Peter Straughan's writing: the film shows the Church without any holy guidance from above. It is just an hypocritical human institution which keeps secrets to sustain. The film claims to unveil secrets but it denies the reality of men and women giving their life for Christ. Adding to this, a few heresies (including that Jesus Christ doubted his faith) and you get a 2/5 stars cocktail."

Growing up Catholic I followed the news for each pope elected since John XXIII, so I knew the process. My old sense of yuck at the all male cast in their red dresses and gold jewelry, their arrogance and obliviousness turned me off at the beginning.. Why would Amanpour have had that reaction to what starts out looking like just another pretentious pope movie? Why had some of my favorite superb actors agreed to be in it? I soon enough found out. Near the end of the movie, both husband and I totally captivated, I demanded that he pause it: I was too pulled in and not ready for whatever the big reveal was about to be regarding one of these cardinals (and Isabella Rosellini, a nun to rival Meryl Streep's character in Judgment) . These characters are some of the best-drawn fictional clergy in movie history. When I was ready, I told my husband turn it back on. I instantly understood Christianne's enthusiastic reaction. My husband and I couldn't stop laughing joyously, just like her. We've decided to invite a bunch of our movie-loving friends to see \"Conclave\" at our house the evening after Christmas/Hanukah. Beautifully, masterfully contrived, filmed, directed, and acted. See it. Well worth our $19.99."

Not only are ubiquitous thematic ambitions missing the mark, but over the years empathy has turned to apathy and may soon turn to disdain. Movies should be made FOR you; not TO you. SPOILERS: If there was a creative basis for these themes, I would appreciate it. I'm not opposed to the theme itself. I don't even consider the theme political or sexual in it's nature. What I'm opposed to is it's contrived infusion into the script. Conclave is not bad because of politics (I happen to support individual liberty). It's bad because it's artistically lazy. It's bad because it does not fully optimize the actual story's potential. It's bad because you didn't even take the time to explain why you think this end would even be a good thing. It's bad because you don't even make a case on why you think it would be progress. It's bad because critics can't even condemn it artistically because they fear being confused with bigotry. So it's ultimately bad because it's going to get a RT score that it didn't really earn; but that it got through submission."

We have ambitious men seeking power, reluctant heroes, fire breathing reactionaries, sabotage, manipulation, gamesmanship….and within the last minute of the film we have an out of left field gender bender plot twist. The ending is so abrupt it left me wondering if the producers ran out of money. And the twist felt like pandering to what’s currently controversial rather than a satisfying end to the a story."

The con: it follows many angles and story paths at once and ends up being superficial on all; working out none of them strong enough to become the backbone, carrying this movie. There are a number of things wrong with the cardinals fighting to become the next pope, but while the movie wants to make you think there is something huuge underway, all of those faults turn out as rather petty things, with no grand schemes or plans or a mastermind that are uncovered later in the movie. The movie is nevertheless entertaining, although part of that is the expectation it creates that at some point things will speed up, and stuff starts to happen... which is never fulfilled, so at the end, one is left with a feeling of \"okay, that was all?\" - and feels a little... cheated."

I was at least hoping for an interesting historic perspective by getting parts of the Catholic faith, Cardinaltry, and Pope election right....They couldn't even manage that. There is a bizarre twist out of nowhere at the end of the movie that thoroughly cements this film in the year 2024 which will be looked back on even more unfavorably than it already is as time moves forward.

I believed virtually none of it: the characters were largely cardboard cutouts. The plot twists had the subtlety of an offstage explosion (I hope I'm not giving anything away). The heartfelt speech was a pale imitation of Shoes of the Fisherman. And as for the final catharsis -- listen: I'm Jewish, and I can't believe there is a semi-literate Catholic anywhere who could have believed it for a minute. Fiennes may rightfully win the Oscar, but not even a performance that good could redeem the screenplay. IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD."

Undoubtedly blessed with phenomenal talents in cinematography, directing and acting, the film is choreographed and executed to very high standards. There are some standouts, but my list differs to many, so I’ll leave you to decide for yourselves who yours are. So, it’s solid, evidently created and curated by talented folk, and showcases some exceptional performances… what’s the catch? Well, whilst the story connects with the politics of the day, it fails to address significant issues facing the church, and religions in general, which is a shame. It also falls woefully short in tension and suspense, only giving brief peaks in an otherwise holy arena. Overall, whilst a solid drama, it is hit-and-miss as a thriller, and wastes an intriguing twist, so ends up being a papal mystery replete with talent, though somewhat lacking in the intrigue and emotion it tells us it is made of"

    "review": "Conclave is a lovely visual experience. Stéphane Fontaine (cinematography), Suzie Davies (Production Design) and Roberta Federico (Art Direction) deserve accolades. The artistic beauty of this film reminds me of The Danish Girl and Brooklyn. Edward Berger directed the film. The cast is top notch: Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, Sergio Castellitto, and Isabella Rossellini. The writers (Peter Straughan and Robert Harris) wrote excellent dialogue. They cleverly steered the audience in two directions toward the conclusion. The conversations include an unbiased scrutiny of opposing political views. When the one ending is apparent, I felt a little miffed by the logic and the editorializing. ‘You, dear audience, must know that this is the way the world should work.’ I thought the ending jumped the shark. Always blame the writers. ;) I’ve never seen a movie I didn’t like, but I’ve watched a thousand films I’ll never watch again. I’ll watch Conclave again because of the color, photography, and visual artistry. The cinematic experience is like revisiting my favorite art pieces at my local museum. If you like hagiographic topics, I recommend the TV mini-series The Young Pope with Jude Law and Diane Keaton, and The New Pope, the follow up mini-series with Jude Law and John Malkovitch. The 2019 film The Two Popes is an excellent look at Pope Benedict XVI (Anthony Hopkins) and Pope Francis (Jonathan Pryce)."

This political thriller masterfully weaves a tale of intrigue, ambition, and hidden agendas, keeping you captivated with its suspenseful plot and compelling characters. The film excels in its portrayal of the power dynamics and subtle manipulations that unfold within the confines of the conclave. The cardinals, each with their own beliefs and ambitions, engage in a delicate dance of alliances and betrayals as they strive to influence the outcome of the election. The performances are superb, with Ralph Fiennes delivering a standout performance as Cardinal Lomeli, a man of unwavering faith navigating the murky waters of Vatican politics. The supporting cast, including Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, and Isabella Rossellini, adds depth and complexity to the narrative, creating a compelling ensemble of characters. The film's atmosphere is masterfully crafted, with the grandeur and solemnity of the Vatican setting enhancing the sense of intrigue and suspense. The pacing is deliberate, allowing for a gradual build-up of tension as the cardinals' deliberations unfold. While the film's ending may leave some viewers wanting a more definitive resolution, it effectively highlights the complexities and ambiguities inherent in the pursuit of power and faith. \"Conclave\" is a thought-provoking and suspenseful thriller that offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of one of the world's most powerful institutions."

Beautifully shot (and acted) we now know the inner workings and politics of the worlds most exclusive boys club. As well made as this movie is it falls victim to the nonsense that is religious order and lost me quite a few times through the journey. Spotlight tells a different story than Conclave, sadly I found that far more interesting for all the wrong reasons. Worth a watch once though."

    "review": "I thought this proverb encapsulates what I think: \"A man who chases two rabbits catches neither\" The concept was brilliant and full of potential, but it took a turn into over-the-top fantasy that just wasn’t needed. The suggestive atmosphere and the delicate, thought-provoking themes were already more than enough to make it stand out without all the extra exaggeration. The movie spirals into a mix of Sherlock Holmes and a Marvel movie. Lawrence discovers the compromising documents hidden just behind the defunt Pope's bed, and then—the nun, yes, the nun—ends up killing Trembley’s candidacy. All of this unfolds alongside not one, but two terrorist attacks for good measure, among many crazy things. The atmosphere, the conclave, and the subject matter—the moral corruption of the Church—are perfectly suited to being exposed while developing an intriguing thriller, without all this."

    "review": "This film is worth watching for its strong performances, beautiful cinematography, and insightful look at the process of electing a pope. Isabella Rossellini, despite her limited screen time, gives a standout performance that steals the show. The slow pacing fits the film’s reflective tone, though it lacks the intricate plotting or twists one might expect. However, the final twist feels unnecessary and slightly out of place. Overall, it’s a solid and thoughtful film."

    "review": "I wasn't expecting a great deal from Conclave, yet it all unfolds with such precision: an unlikely potboiler that Edward Berger presents not only thoughtfully, but viciously and deliciously. You'd think that being locked in a room with a gathering of elderly gentlemen deviously attempting to shaft each other wouldn't be a lot of fun. However, the whole thing is a blast from start to finish, presenting the secretive papal election as a high-stakes thriller, with the Catholic Cardinals manipulated like chess pieces by those who crave ultimate power. A deftly executed and gripping tale of secrets, lies and human ambition. Fiennes is at the top of his game, while the supporting cast conspires to wrap this tale of faith, power and morality in sumptuous dramatic cloth. The sometimes scandalous material is handled smoothly, without fuss, and the film's very restraint reads as a kind of moral intelligence, the final result is a high-camp gripper. Conclave packs so many twists, turns, ponders and scrutinises throughout its runtime that it's hard not to think of this as the world's most serious Carry-On film. A real sleeper hit."

Had this movie been made 50 years ago, it might have been shocking. In 2024, it's more of a snooze fest. Audiences are sick of this type of storyline. We've been beat over the head with this for the past 20 years or more. SPOILERS BELOW, SPOILERS BELOW.........
