Nat is one of the original avengers, the reason why we have so many more women within the MCU and this is what she gets?? Dont get me wrong, I loved the film. its a comfort for me but she deserved better. I wanted to see what we saw in Age of ultron, I want to see our Ballerina assassin. Bucky's widow to his his winter. Though I love Yelena and the dynamic they have, this film was just a setup to bring her in."

Honestly, if this had been released during Phase 3, I think it would‚Äôve hit even harder. What I really appreciated was how it gave us a deeper connection to Natasha. We finally got to see where she came from, the horrors of the Red Room, and how women were trained‚Äîand tortured‚Äîto become assassins. It added so much depth to her character. I also loved how the movie showed that Natasha had a real family beyond the Avengers. That dynamic made her story more meaningful. In fact, if her family had been more involved or even present after her death in Endgame, I think it would‚Äôve made that moment even more emotional‚Äîbut that‚Äôs just my take. Overall, this is a solid film that gave Black Widow the spotlight she deserved."

Black Widow is flawed, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but is it worse than the others I mentioned? Or is a coincidence that Cap Marvel and Marvels are also among the worst ranked in the MCU? I think not. BW is way more entertaining and interesting than all the Thor movies combined‚Ä¶ A great cast not least the supporting actors and tho the thriller spy theme is somewhat drowned in the high octane explosions and loooong action scenes. But even those scenes are pretty entertaining. With a running time of nearly 2,5 hours the movie may wants to do too many things in one movie. But rather that then the opposite as in for example Thor: L&T What a complete waste that movie was‚Ä¶ Is BW better than ‚Äúthe girl w dragon tattoo‚Äù series, a movie with a similar theme? Hell Yes!"

Florence Pugh was the stand out, and her character's dynamic with Natasha was really enjoyable. Taskmaster....... Oh Taskmaster......

I loved Yelena Belova: the performance Florence Pugh gave in that regard was funny and moving in the same time. I also liked the Red Guardian, a fun character that I would like to know more about. The plot was interestingly catchy. The photography is a strong argument for this film. It has good scenes filmed outdoor, with natural light. The artistic direction in general is a success. The few weaknesses are to find in some fight scenes, poorly assembled, and in the villain that we only see for about 10 minutes in total."

I was hoping for a darker, more Cold War era centric espionage film that focused on her origins and upbringing. It seems arbitrary to tell a side story that takes place just after Civil War but at the same time it works thematically and callback to existing lore will gratify MCU fans. Black Widow doesn't really feel like a fresh, powerful installment to the MCU but it gives stronger emotional context to Romanov's sacrifice and establishes great new characters that we'll hopefully see more of in the future."

You do not have to have seen the other Marvel film to enjoy this Awesome origin story of Natasha Romanoff, a Russian spy turned Avenger. It Is 1995, Russian spies Alexei Shostakov and Melina Vostokoff go in deep undercover in Ohio USA. Posed as a family with with two young daughters, Natasha and Yelena, (ages 11 & 6} they steal secret SHIELD intel and return to Russia. But the young girls are taken by General Dreykov and sent to the infamous Red Room and trained to be assassins. \"My girls are toughest girls in the world\" - Alexei Now twenty years later, the very intel they stole is being used to control \"Black Widow\" assassins all over the world...including Yelena. Now to stop Dreykov and destroy the Red Room the family must reunite and fight together. But were they ever a real family? \"It was real for me\" - Yelena \"I'm sorry. We had our orders and we played our roles\" - Melina Black Widow is my favorite of all the Superhero films.... and it is so much more. This is a great well written story about a unlikely family but with lots of action, mystery, spy and hero stuff, and family feuds and reunions. I saw Black Widow on the big screen when it came out and watching again, I really forgot how good is, Way beyond my expectations..... And a Awesome cast! Some of my favorite actors. Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Rachel Weisz, Olga Kurylenko, William Hurt, Ray Winstone \"Family, back together again.\" -Alexei"

Black Widow struggles on its main character, its main antagonist, its visuals, and its story. Everything else is welcomed with open arms. Simply, this movie is awesome not because of Black Widow. The worst part of the movie is the very character it is trying to represent. There are not enough reasons to like Black Widow except that she is played by Scarlett Johansson. The movie gives you enough reasons why we should not like her. She killed a little girl, she abandoned her sister, she killed even more people, etc. I believe the film is trying to get us to show empathy for her. What it did was leave its audience feeling guilty for loving a character for a long period of time."

The villain isn't bad but doesn't get a lot of screen time and needed more time to go against Widow instead of just at the end spitting plot expose. Her sister isn't bad and neither are the parents but they needed more time together as it is somewhat jarring to see them being secret assassins and Red Guardian out of nowhere from when we first see them at the start. The music is solid with a good mix of modern pop music and cinematic , but I wouldn't call it catchy. The cinematography isn't bad either with very well done practical action but the CGI especially at the end is too much and isn't as good. There are memorable locations, and some well done scenes when the family bonds together but this gets offset by some dumb choices, over the top action at the end that feels out of place, a floating castle in the sky similar to the villains space station in Moonraker and why would he be so stupid and leave his ring behind and why would she let the assassin out. Also the BMW crashing in the subway stairs was laughably bad. The editing and pacing are decent also. This has a weird Filler Movie/Origin Story approach that works but not very smoothly. This give a disjointed feel throughout that eventually makes sense but doesn't flow smooth. This needed a proper story arc throughout her life in a linear fashion like Wonder Woman and Superman The Movie. Instead it feels like its cramming a lot in that does work though more than it misses. The ending feels like it belongs in a Sci-Fi Movie not in a grounded non super powered hero like Black Widow and goes against most of the tone of rest of the film. This balances action, telling an origin story and character development well enough. Although the ending goes off the rails a little bit it still is entertaining. Overall anyone who is a fan of S.J., the director, or Marvel films will have fun with this. Besides that its just a run of the mill action film without the context of the MCU."

The gravity of Budapest was lacking, the truth behind the Black Widows was ill-conceived and I was just bored throughout. There were a few unique moments of storytelling and some clever callbacks to other entries in the MCU. Florence Pugh was great, though all the fake Russian accents were grating at times.

An older child in a family of Russian spies embedded in Ohio, Natasha along with her kid sister Yelena and parents are forced to flee the country when her father, Alexei (David Harbour) is busted after completing a major espionage mission. Natasha is reluctant and fears the return to her country of origin, possibly for things she has seen and experienced, while Alexei and her mother, Melina (Rachel Weisz) are bound by their loyalty to a General Dreykov (Ray Winstone). We then cut forward to a point of time, post the events of \"Civil War\", with Natasha already an Avenger and on the run for being an outlaw by affiliation with Captain America and the squad that backed him. Yelena (Florence Pugh) is now a brainwashed Black Widow assassin working for Dreykov and his \"Red Room\", but during a mission to assassinate a rebel is freed from her mind-controlling chemical/drug. Yelena seeks out help from her sister and the rest of her family who have been split and separated over the years, to find Dreykov. And it is indeed a fun reunion. The film is evidently action packed and the action is good, supported by adequate and slick CGI. Scarlett Johansson leads with a punch and a kick-some performance in what might be potentially her last swing as the \"Widow\". Florence Pugh is an enterprising entry as the younger \"Widow\"; a rising actress, the film makes way for more of her in the Avengers universe. David Harbour is hilarious in his bits, and Rachel Weisz plays an adequate part in the dysfunctional and bantering but fun family. And there are a couple of interesting cameos from Olga Kurylenko and O. T. Fagbenle (of \"The Handmaid's Tale\" fame) It isn't something exceptional ‚Äì but it's tightly held together with a good cast and it's definitely better than some of the recent Marvel content that's been out there. Mostly powered by ScarJo and the represented retribution of women breaking out of manipulative strings, #MeToo or otherwise."

At the same time, it is not as exciting as all other Marvel films before, but it is still fun, brainless and highly familiar.  Some plot details did feel complex or vague during the film's rocky opening, but this improves as the film progresses.  Action is excellent, but it is also fast-paced and differs from the previous films with slightly less excitement and a \"wow factor\".  Music is pleasing but sadly somewhat forgettable, and the audio relating to dialogue sometimes felt challenging to hear.  Either way, it is still an exciting film for the character, but I cannot deny I hoped for something far more significant than being \"just another Marvel film\"."

    "review": "\"Black Widow\" (2021) is a thrilling and well-crafted addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The plot provides a compelling origin story for the titular character, exploring her past and the events that shaped her into the assassin we know and love. The acting is strong, particularly from lead Scarlett Johansson, who brings nuance and depth to her performance. The supporting cast is also excellent, adding layers to the film's complex world and story. The cinematography is visually stunning, capturing the high-stakes action and espionage with a sleek and stylish flair. The direction is confident and effective, keeping the pacing tight and the tension high. The film's score is pulse-pounding and perfectly complements the on-screen action. However, the film can be criticized for its somewhat formulaic plot and predictable twists. Additionally, the film's villain is underdeveloped and fails to provide a truly compelling threat to the main characters. Overall, \"Black Widow\" is a thrilling and well-crafted film that provides a satisfying origin story for the titular character. While it may not reach the heights of some of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it is still a solid entry that fans of the franchise will enjoy."

    "review": "Cate Shortland's long-awaited addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe has finally made its theatrical debut. The film mixes established characters and explosive action in a globe-trotting adventure. Johansson makes her final appearance as the titular hero in a story that delves into past and future events in the elaborate universe. Fresh off the events of 'Captain America: Civil War', Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), now a political fugitive, must go into hiding and begin anew after violating the Sokovia Accords. But when her past catches up with her, Natasha must dive back into a dangerous conspiracy, confront the red in her ledger, and outrun an unstoppable force. Cate Shortland makes her MCU debut alongside a star-studded cast that includes Rachel Weisz, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, OT Fagbenle and Ray Winstone. Shortland manages to bring these exciting new characters together in a way that explains who these characters are while keeping the explosive action moving. Johansson once again slips into the role of the Russian spy with ease. She delivers a brilliant performance, making her eighth appearance as the trained assassin the perfect way to end Natasha's story within the MCU. Florence Pugh's Marvel debut allows the talented actress to show off her vast range, bringing the character of Yelena Belova (fellow Black Widow assassin) to the screen. Pugh's performance is comedic and emotional, and her sister-like bond with Natasha is the perfect way to mix some much-needed comedy into the film's dark subject matter. The film's post-credits scene implies that Marvel intends to bring Yelena into the Disney+ series 'Hawkeye', which should arrive Fall of this year. So fans of the blonde assassin shouldn't have to wait long before seeing her back in the MCU. Like every other Marvel production, 'Black Widow' does a splendid job referencing MCU past and future, providing context for previous references. But the film also gives viewers a much-needed insight into Natasha's past life. Despite Marvel's impressive track record in the visual effects department, 'Black Widow' doesn't appear to be up to par with the numerous other MCU projects that came before it. Natalie Abizadeh brings her talent to the screen, providing each character with attractive yet practical hairstyles that range from intricate braids to simplistic ponytails. Even though 'Black Widow' is a Marvel production and comes from a studio most notably known for their big-budget, explosive blockbusters, it still manages to deal with incredibly deep themes such as family, free will and human nature. Shortland features shots of fireflies at both the start and end of the film; these insects resonate with themes such as hope and guidance. But more importantly, fireflies relate to the importance of our internal character, which in Natasha's case is something that the character struggles to deal with. If you're new to watching Marvel's vast, interconnected universe, then 'Black Widow' might not be the best place to start for numerous reasons. Not just because the majority of viewers will already know the events of the 2019 film 'Avengers: Endgame', but because there's a plethora of minor details and references that will fly straight over your head. The stunt choreography displayed over the 134 minutes is a somewhat fresh take on what viewers have previously seen, with no vibranium shields or telekinetic powers. All these characters have to rely on is mundane weapons and their surroundings (e.g. furniture/ home decor), as seen in the Budapest apartment fight scene in which Natasha and Yelena attempt to strangle each other with a curtain. The fact these characters don't have hi-tech weaponry gives it a slight sense of realism and adds another layer of tension. But viewers are moved to the edge of their seats wondering who will win. Overall, 'Black Widow' is a film that is a balanced mix of hilarious comedy, emotional drama and explosive action, led by a stellar cast that each provides brilliant performances in a film that contributes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in more ways than one. Cate Shortland gifts viewers a heartfelt goodbye to the titular character in the 24th addition to the forever-growing Marvel universe."

    "review": "Finally we have a Black Widow solo film & it's finally released!!! Although about 7 years too late unfortunately. Don't get me wrong I'm super pumped we have a BW solo film, I just feel it probably should've been out back in 2014 after Winter Solder. Or at least well before the character had been killed off in the MCU. So of course knowing that, this film really didn't have the weight it probably should've. I mean we already know how Natasha's story is going to turn out. All that aside BW was still a very entertaining and highly enjoyable film! Not the best MCU film, but a solid entry. Albeit a weaker storyline. She's basically on a mission to bring down the \"Red Room\" and people behind it.  While BW was supposed to expand on Natasha's past we get some of that and we are introduced to her \"sister\" Yelena Belova portrayed to perfection by Florence Pugh. Yelena was pretty much the stand out for me. I suppose that is a good thing as she's most likely going to be taking up the mantle now. Yelena is a very likable and at times funny character. She's able to go toe to toe with Natasha as well as hold her own in fights. Between Yelena & Natasha you didn't really need the other \"family\" characters. Their dynamic together was awesome. They felt like true sisters. Melina (the mom) was ok, but barely any excitement or much use for her. Alexei/Red Guardian (the dad) was completely useless. He did not have a single thing to do and very little action. Both of those characters could've been omitted for me. They didn't lean much into the family dynamics as they could've so I felt both of them were just there for the sake of padding the talking scenes as neither had much action or furthered the story.  Speaking of the action, BW fell into WW84s problem in the third act. The third act here was more of a spectacle than WW84, but still very minimal hand to hand fighting. There was a brief scene with Natasha vs the other Widows, Red Guardian vs Taskmaster and Natasha vs Taskmaster. All of which were concluded so fast it made the big finale sequence very underwhelming. Speaking of Taskmaster there is a twist with the character, but still it's used very minimal. There was a pretty decent sequence early on on a bridge with Taskmaster and Natasha which was probably the standout. Other than that the character was very under utilized and subsequently \"defeated\" too quickly. The first half of the movie had some pretty good excitement and entertaining sequences, but slows down until the sloppy final act. This film had a lot of potential, but while enjoyable, it didn't live up to to that potential unfortunately. The end credit scene is actually really nice and helps set up some future stories. I will definitely check this out again as BW deserves her solo film, but just wish it were slightly better story wise and come along a lot sooner."

Scarlett gives the expected engaging performance, but it's Florence Pugh who elevates this movie. She alone is worth watching this. David Harbour has some great scenes too and is pure comedy gold. Apart from the overblown finale the action looks very real and not just CGI. The highlight is the fight between Natasha and Yelena."

The only thing I have a problem with is that it wasn't as meaningful cause it was made when the main character already died in the Endgame movie, no high stakes, no real danger to the character which is the only reason this movie wasn't completely perfect to me. If they released it before Endgame and made some meaningful connection to the Hawkeye character to make her death even more emotional it would elevate both movies."

Scarlett Johansen's Black Widow is a fun character, although her character is undercut by the fact that we already know her fate in Avengers: Endgame (this movie was supposed to be made and released before Endgame). Florence Pugh's Yelena steals the show, and the rest of the cast is also well-acted and adds some humor and emotion. And though the action scenes are entertaining, and the emotional moments tug on the heartstrings, Black Widow has some flaws. The stakes are more personal than global, which is fine considering what we know happens to Natasha Romanoff later on. The villain isn't exciting, but this movie is more about the personal redemption and arc of Romanoff than the villain (for better or worse). But the bigger problems lie in the secondary villain and action scenes. Taskmaster had so much potential to be a great villain, and though they had some great action scenes, the charcater was totally undercut by the end of the movie. The action, though fun, was very brutal and doled out vast punishment to the characters. If these were superpowered heroes, that would be fine, but both Nat and Yelena are regular humans that should not survive the damage they take in this movie. The final action scene is fun, but for such a grounded movie, feels very out-of-place. Overall, Black Widow suffers the most from such a delayed release, but the majority of it is fun enough to be worth a watch."

    "review": "Black Widow can be summed up in one sentence: Marvel x James Bond / Mission Impossible. This movie relied more on action set pieces and big explosions to make up for the adherent lack of superpowers in this movie, which I really dug. Watching Black Widow, Yelena Belova, Red Guardian and Taskmaster all fight hand to hand, skilled combat was really awesome and a refreshing break from superpowers that was rather needed, and I would say I preferred this to the standard superpower fight scenes. The newly introduced characters of Red Guardian and Yelena Belova created many more exciting opportunities for future movies and the potential replacement Black Widow in Yelena Belova. However, I would have to say that they ruined Taskmaster, as they made her totally different from the comics, which although that didn't bother me turning her into a superhero really ruined any chance of Taskmaster as a future villain and the remaining part needed for the Thunderbolts. General Ross had a unique but confusing appearance in which he was included but generally forgotten about with a time skip stopping us from seeing why he was there, but as long as it's justified in a later film I'm good with it. The main villain was Dreykov, a rather forgettable villain that was rather basic although needed to set up the next movies in phase 4 and the progression of Yelena Belova for future movies. The end credits scene hints at a future movie where we will see Yelena Belova vs Ronin which I am super hyped to see and definitely can't wait to see. Overall, Black Widow set up a great amount of new movies and was a really good start to Phase 4 of Marvel movies."

Then Disney+ arrive in my lounge, I want something new but not taxing on a bad Long Covid day. This was just the ticket. It's the love child of Marvel and Mission:Impossible, complete with terrific stunts and action set pieces. The central villain's plot may seem hard to pin down, but Johansson is good and it's lovely to see the always excellent Florence Pugh given a key role in a film like this. There's a pleasing lack of the meaningless cityscape destruction that so often features in superhero films, and Marvel's trademark style of wit fits well in the action spy context. Fans of the tv show Alias like me may spot some of its influence also, and it seemed to me that there's more than sniff of a feminist take about this that works pleasingly (though of course women should critique that). Yes it's still quite generic (and, of course, overlong ‚Ä¶ but not Endgame overlong at least), but the mix of genres definitely gives it a different feel throughout, to the extent that even Ray Winstone's absurd attempt at an accent doesn't jar too much. Terrific entertainment just when I needed it, I'm freshly motivated to try catching up with the rest of the MCU films I've missed."

Unfortunately, the good things run out here. The Russian super soldier guy is a buffoon, who doesn't quite understand why his pseudo-daughters hate him after he handed them over to the evil Russians that turned them into weapons. The woman that was the closest thing Natasha and Yelena had to a mother is just a mad scientist in a catsuit. These two \"parents\" are horrible people, and why Natasha went to them to them to put the Red Room in the ground instead of calling in, oh I don't know, CAPTAIN AMERICA and his posse is beyond me. There's also no Hawkeye. For a character that is so important to Natasha's story, he's mentioned but never shows up.

Florence Pugh stole the show quite often, Scarlett Johansson seemed to work hard to make space for Florence Pugh as well as David Harbour and Rachel Weisz, who are ALSO solid actors - though stretching to be parental as they are only 10 and 14 years older than ScarJo, respectively. It was fine, really. Happy to have watched it. But it didn't quite measure up to the best of what MCU can deliver."

It delves into Black Widow's history and introduces her spy \"family\" that she was undercover in America with for years. It shows the other \"widows\"--orphan girls who are adopted into an elite assassin program at an early age--and we get to met Black Widow's \"sister\", \"mother\", and \"father\" (AKA The Red Guardian, AKA Captain Russia, the USSR counterpart to Captain American). Great comic relief moments, especially with the Red Guardian (seriously, he kinda steals the show). I just wish it had been made earlier."

But flight physics + avalanches and skycities and terminal velocity fights, etc... the list of physics defying scenes is very long for what is a lower than crazy level of powers. I'd expected this from Thor Ragnarok, but Black Widow? That said, I was totally entertained. The characters are multifaceted, (some of them) and often entertaining as well as looking or being badass. There is the right amount of comedy sprinkled in. The fight scenes don't tend to last TOO long or get dull. There is a LOT of human damage that gets hand waived and I gets the Sykovia Accords make sense, hmm? Watching this in order, right after Civil War, was great. There are quite a number of tie-ins that serve to link this story to those before and after it. I appreciated those details. In the end I loved some of the new characters (Pugh was great!) and had a good time - through three 45min viewing sessions. Streaming has spoiled me and these MCU flicks can be long."

    "review": "Whilst I am glad the MCU has finally given its first female superhero her own solo film, Natasha Romanoff does not feel like the main character in her own story. The film does a nice job delving into Natasha as a character, but only provides glimpses of her background - one that acts as social commentary for child trafficking, an aspect of the film brought up during the intro sequence but is otherwise largely ignored for the rest of the film. One of the bigger problems that seem consistent across all Marvel Studios productions, is how they add humor inappropriately during points of the film where it tries to deal with serious topics. In Black Widow, a saving grace is that the comedy was fairly enjoyable. Black Widow also suffers from Marvel Studios' villain problem, where its primary antagonists are barely characters and more so plot points that exist for a conflict to occur. We learn very little about Natasha's rivals and they ultimately felt like unnecessary and uninteresting additions to the MCU. The best aspect of the film to me was the cast. Scarlett Johansson reprises her role as Natasha Romanoff and does an excellent job in the role as usual. Joining her are Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz, and David Harbour who make up the most enjoyable and heartfelt moments in the film."

Task Master was an absolute disappointment, I was so looking forward to this comic book menace finally being brought to the screen.

Cate Shortland (the director) had a mindset of how can I make this an epic movie that adds to to the collection of the greater MCU lore (u can check she says it multiple times in interviews) when this should have been something different that stands on it's own but they didn't do that. If u watched any of Cates other movies she then u know she makes indie films, her films have a poeticness to them on top of being raw and honest and a feeling of being in the moment like nothing u have ever seen, and if u really do understand Natasha Romanoff than you would know that's who she is on the inside and because of that I was excited to see this movie through Cates eyes which is also Natasha eyes since the way they see the world is so similar. Unfortunately we didn't get that, but hey if your a family person that loves fart jokes with stupid happy endings, then u will love this movie."

    "review": "Too little and too late, that's the simple single-sentence review for Black Widow which finally released after four post-production delays. Of course, those delays are not the reason why this film came about too late, that was always going to be an issue. Black Widow takes place between the 2016 Captain America: Civil War and the 2018 Avengers: Infinity War with Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson) being a fugitive on the run following the Avengers breaking up over disagreements regarding government surveillance. This middle-of-the-road placement of the film doesn't affect the main narrative much as it's isolated to characters unique to this film rather than the more crossover-heavy films the MCU have put out lately, but at the same time it can't be ignored that the film feels like it should have been released in 2017 rather than after the 2019 Avengers: Endgame where Natasha ultimately was killed off. Her fate in Endgame being sealed does hurt some of the tension in the film since even if you wouldn't expect a Black Widow film to kill her off, the fact that it literally can't kill her off alters your perspective quite a bit. It's just unfortunate and a testament to how Disney's reluctance to make this film for the longest time has left scars in the script that can't heal. The story involves Natasha reuniting with her foster-sister, Yelena (Florence Pugh), from before her indoctrination into The Red Room, the global network of assassins that take little girls and turn them into programmed killers. Natasha and Yelena set out to take down The Red Room. It's fairly straight forward and you most likely figured out the few twists in the story from just watching the trailer. It's clear that the film wants to evoke more of a James Bond vibe than a typical superhero film, from the opening title sequences set to an awkward slowed down cover of Smells Like Teen Spirit to the more visceral and violent action scenes feeling right out of the Daniel Craig Bond films that take up the first half of the film. It's a breath of fresh air that unfortunately is lost in the final act when it becomes a more standard superhero film despite all this. The performances in the film works quite well with Johansson looking far more comfortable as Natasha in this film than in any of the seven films she was in before this. Pugh as Yelena is the stand-out star and the hints that she'll take up the Black Widow mantle in future MCU media is something I welcome. Black Widow is not a terrible film, but it's also not a decent film. It's a dull if inoffensive action adventure that awkwardly tries to slot itself in between other films to not have to deal with the fact that they waited so long to make this film that the character had both been killed off in-universe and lost most of her popularity from nearly a decade ago. It's certainly not worth going back to theaters or paying a Disney+ premium price for, that's for sure."

This movie would have been immensely more interesting had it been released following Civil War which is when the story takes place. The fact of the matter is that it's a story that didn't need to be told for a character whose storyline is finished in the present of the MCU. While I believe you can tell a story about a character who is no longer alive, you have to make the story matter. This story absolutely didn't matter. It's serves as a quasi-origin story at the beginning with a side story about Natasha dealing with her life as an assassin with no family. There are some touching moments, and the characters have decent chemistry together, but the movie felt so unnecessary. It was clearly made to be a big-budget 2 hour lead in to the Hawkeye show. This seems to be the beginning of a dark period for the MCU. Many of its heavy hitters have tied a bow on their storylines which means Marvel will try to squeeze out as many stories as they can from any other superhero still remaining. What's unfortunate is that Far From Home made me feel like the MCU could continue even without Iron Man and Captain America. However, if the future MCU movies continue to maintain the quality of Black Widow, I'll probably just stick with the movies of established heroes that are remaining from the Infinity Saga."

I'm one of the people who didn't like it much ..."

    "review": "Muito \"engra√ßadinho\",at√© demais. O terceiro ato revela um vil√£o asqueroso que n√£o combina com o clima descontra√≠do do filme e que simplesmente √© um enorme retcon,j√° que o filme simplesmente tentar enfiar guela abaixo no espectador que esse cara √© um super manipulador(controla todos os governos de grandes pot√™ncias) que age h√° muito tempo sem que nem a SHIELD ou a Hydra soubessem dele. Simplesmente intrag√°vel esse roteiro da parte final e ainda por cima exagera no CGI e finaliza um arco bem for√ßado(come√ßa pesad√≠ssimo e termina leve) de personagem da Vi√∫va Negra. Ela merecia mais,sem contar os takes de c√¢mera na bunda dela."

    "review": "Black Widow, directed by Cate Shortland. The main character is Natasha Romanoff, played by Scarlett Johansson. The story is about a young girl who is part of an experience to put young girls in combat. This experience destroys her life. One day she finds her little sister who was also in this experience. The two sisters go in pursuit of the red room where the experience happened, to kill the person responsible for the experience. They are then accompanied by their parents who actually helped in the experience, particularly the mom. The special effects are inventive, the photography is incredible So I find this movie realistic and impressive. I recommend to go and see it if you like action movies."

    "review": "It wasn't bad, but it wasn't up to the story it wanted to tell. Huge Natasha fan, and Johansson is on point here, but everything around her isn't. The script is weak---except the fake family bit especially the flashbacks which packed a punch. Decent fight scenes, the sister is okay, but no where near up to filling the hole left by Black Widow's demise. Yet. We'll see how it goes from here."

    "review": "Black Widow was produced by Cate ShortLand in 2021. Natasha, the main character is played by Scarlett Johansson. It is an action movie that is about Natasha and her sister, Yolona, who were recruited by Russian government to become \"black widow\" and fight the American government. Few years later, Natasha side with American and she became an Avengers. Yolana escape from black widow organisation and they fight together Russian government to free every black widow. The plot is basic to action movie, but the ending is poignant. Special effects are superb, especially with pan shot and long shot. The acting is stunning, the casting is amazing. The script is very interesting, characters are dive few years later after the Cold War, but we could feel tension between USA and Russia. This movie is outstanding, acting is perfect and, despite a poor plot, and I love Cold war references. I recommend this film everyone love historic and action movie."

    "review": "The difference between all of the main characters in the family brings truth to the saying, \"Opposites attract.\" The movie is so light-hearted in serious moments and action sequences but still manages to bring emotion and character development through the whole 2 hours and 15 minutes. Definitely not the best Marvel movie, but it is well up there in terms of a solo-titled superhero movie. 100% better than Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman 1984, and other female-led superhero films recently."

Taskmaster felt underutilized, and the CGI was clearly very rushed. disappointing that Marvel will only pull out all of the stops with cgi for every movie that has a white male actor. Other than those things, this movie is definitely worth watching, and ScarJo and the other actors' performances are entertaining and captivating."

But the film is also willing to go dark (particularly in the opening credits sequence). Yes, the third act is a buffet of mediocre CGI, perhaps even bad CGI, but Florence Pugh is amazing and the film has a lot of interesting things to say."

    "review": "This for me is yet again another bland blockbuster film released from Marvel. I was hyped for this film and watched it the day it came out. Director Cate Shortland is a fairly unknown director and this was her first big-budget film. I can see what she was trying to go for in this movie but sadly failed while writing got in the way of things. The first start of the movie is just showing you how rushed and bland the script is. I also think the action was very boring, especially for a Marvel movie. Marvel movies are known for their amazing fight scenes (like in blade 2) and this one really failed to do so."

    "review": "Plot was somewhat convoluted and all over the place at times. Action scenes, stunts, and special FX were solid. Acting was a bit stiff and the non-action scenes really dragged things down to the point of boredom. Final show down with villain at the end was well worth the price of admission. Rescue scene at Russian prison was also awesome. Who expected an avalanche?! Nice touch. Other facts: Johansson sued Disney studios for releasing the movie digitally on Disney Plus too soon after movie hit the theaters. Johansson felt it a breach of contract. Johansson and Disney settled for an unnamed amount. Johansson was seeking 50 million in damages. The suit alleged that Johansson lost out on tens of millions of dollars in box office bonuses."

It focuses on a dead character without necessarily trying to implant ground to resurrect the character, but clear the path to moving on from Natasha Romanoff's tragic death in Avengers: Endgame. It is absolutely packed with amazing action and I think it would have been more well-received if it was actually made in 2016, the year it takes place in. It passed the time, for sure, but it is still guaranteed to give you a very enjoyable time."
