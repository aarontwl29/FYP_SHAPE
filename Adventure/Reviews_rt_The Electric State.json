    "review": "The Electric State is a baffling, joyless slog that leaves you wondering why it was even made. From start to finish, the film stumbles through a clunky, incoherent narrative that tries to be emotional and profound but ends up feeling empty and directionless. The acting is flat across the board, with performances that feel either completely disinterested or overly forced‚Äînever genuine, never engaging. The storytelling is a disjointed mess, dragging viewers through a world that‚Äôs poorly explained and even more poorly utilized. Nothing connects emotionally, the pacing is tedious, and the tone shifts are jarring. There‚Äôs no payoff, no momentum, and absolutely nothing redeemable in the way the plot or characters are handled. For a movie with such a promising visual concept, The Electric State is shockingly devoid of energy, creativity, or purpose. A complete misfire in every sense‚Äîforgettable, frustrating, and frankly a waste of time."

Script is average and direction seems average too., as the actors are all good ones, but don't particularly shine here. Reminiscent of the goonies, (perhaps because of the doctor) but without the heart and soul of those 80's kids movies."

It seems to me nowadays people have such a big habit at just consuming content that they can't appreciate something simpler but with a heart. I think the story was a nicely written one, the actors did a good job and the robots were fantastic. The plot may be not the newest on the block but what's important here is the relationship between brother and sister and the take on connection and disconnection. I appreciated that not all the choices were easy choices. Maybe I wouldn't have add the final sequence, that was a bit just to ease a pain that, in my opinion, should have stayed there. Like this ... It's just my opinion but I would have preferred it without the final scene Nonetheless the movie is a nice one to watch and one I would watch again."

Na verdade, eu tinha uma esperan√ßa de que o final fosse um pouco menos mon√≥tono. Spoiler, n√£o foi. Foi um final previs√≠vel, mon√≥tono e chato, mesmo com toda a cena de luta, brigas, soldados vs. rob√¥s, e etc. O enredo tinha tudo para transformar o filme em algo interessante.

I honestly can't believe the other reviews I see, as this is the first movie I've watched in a very long time, and especially in recent years, that's made me excited and invested in it. It's also a work of art, you can see the care taken in the designs of the robots and the building of the world, it sets a stage for imagination and it's glorious.

MBB and Chris Pratt try really hard, but the plot is so weak, the human characters so robotic, and the robotic characters so cliched, I watched the second half just to see how bad it got! I wasn‚Äôt disappointed in its ability to prove me right. Was it sci-fi? Was it a comedy? Was it a heartwarming family tear-jerker? I think it tries to be all three, with end result a melange of schtick and predictability no one would enjoy. As the closing credits rolled, I was amazed that there actually people who paid for this disaster to be made.

    "review": "It‚Äôs such a shame that the directors of the best MCU films, the Russo brothers, fumble projects outside of the MCU. It is already proven that a loose adaptation of the source material works for superhero comics, especially those running for more than half a century. This same mindset did not work for The Electric State. This is because it is a single, hauntingly beautiful illustrated novel published in 2018. I was first introduced to this book by a YouTube channel: Curious Archive. I've become a fan ever since. The original story is essentially THE Black Mirror episode to end all Black Mirror episodes. It is set in an alternative 90s where the world has been ravaged by war. It follows Michelle and her brother, Skip, as they journey through desolate America filled with giant, broken, mascot-looking robots as well as streets littered with dead or dying humans hooked to helmets called ‚Äòneurocasters‚Äô. Their journey unveils disturbing truths about the technologic apocalypse. Essentially, The Electric State is an atmospheric horror experience that deals with humanity, connection and the use of technology. Meanwhile, the Netflix film, who had a $300 million budget, failed to capitalize on these elements and instead chose to tell a clich√© action-adventure story about robots who wish to coexist with humans. While there are still themes of the original book in play, like a cautionary tale to unplug every once in a while, ‚Äì it is more of an afterthought instead of the core conflict. To the film‚Äôs merit, the CGI looks decent, as it should be for the budget. And it is very interesting to see the book‚Äôs various bots made tangible and moving. However, it‚Äôs safe to say there will be no proper adaptation of The Electric State, so for those who feel like the film left much to be desired, the original book by Simon St√•lenhag is absolutely more fulfilling."

Is it better as a movie in whole than say E.T. or similar science fiction films that are kid friendly? No, music is dull, but its pretty funny and cute, and if you are between 45 and 55 years old it's equivalent to eating candy pretty much non-stop for two whole hours.

    "review": "The Electric State (2025) The Special Effects Deserved a Better Storyline (11,590 ‚Äì 05 Apr 2025 ‚Äì by Claudio Carvalho) In 1990, the boy Christopher \"Chris\" Greene (Woody Norman) is a genius and pride and joy of his sister Michelle (Millie Bobby Brown). Meanwhile, the robots are protesting against their use by humans and on strike. There is a war between humans and robots, and the robots are winning the battles. Until the day the CEO of Sentre, Ethan Skate (Stanley Tucci), develops a technology to allow humans to upload their minds into drone robots using a helmet and the humans win the war. The robots are exiled in the Exclusion Zone and humans are forbidden to own robots. However, humans use the Sentre helmet to live in the virtual world while the drones work for them. In 1994, the rebel Michelle, who lost her family in a car accident, lives in several foster homes, and now with her abusive foster father Ted Finister (Jason Alexander). She has a problem at school when she refuses to use Sentre helmet during a class. During the night, a Cosmos robot visits her, and she fixes his voice. Soon she learns that the robot is her brother Chris, who is alive. She has an argument with Ted and flees from his foster home to seek out Chris‚Äô whereabouts. She wants to find Dr. Clark Amherst (Ke Huy Quan), who told her that Chris was dead, but he is hidden in the Exclusion Zone. She finds that Ted buys forbidden goods from the smuggler John Keats (Chris Pratt) and looks for him at his address. But Ethan is aware that the Cosmos robot has escaped and looks for the veteran Marshall Bradbury, a.k.a. ‚ÄúThe Butcher of Schenectady‚Äù (Giancarlo Esposito), to hunt down Michelle and the robot. Michelle and Cosmos meet Keats and his robot Herman, but they have been followed by ‚ÄúThe Butcher‚Äù, in the beginning of a dangerous adventure of discovery and friendship while trying to rescue Chris. ‚ÄúThe Electric State‚Äù (2025) is a sci-fi action movie in a dystopian society with state-of-art special effects and a cast with names such as Chris Pratt, Stanley Tucci, Giancarlo Esposito and Millie Bobby Brown. However, the film does not work well. First, the storyline is uneven, alternating a good idea with silly and corny moments. Stanley Tucci is a great villain, but Chris Pratt is not a great hero, and the robots steal the movie. In the end, ‚ÄúThe Electric State‚Äù disappoints and does not deliver the expected by the viewer. My vote is six.

    "review": "As a popcorn movie, the Russo brothers' adaptation of Simon Stalenhag's graphic novel is, dare I say it, actually fine. Set in an alternative 1990s where robots were banished after a failed uprising against their human overlords, a surprisingly flat Millie Bobby Brown plays Michelle, who's searching for her genius younger brother she thought she had lost after a car accident which also killed their parents. Together with Chris Pratt's soldier-turned-smuggler Keats (a role he can play in his sleep by now) and his rather fun Russian doll-inspired robotic sidekick Herman, they uncover a dark secret Stanley Tucci's tech-bro-like baddie Ethan Skate is desperate to keep hidden. Whilst no one would argue that the familiar sounding story is not derivative, and some of the 'plot twists' are obvious, but the execution here is competent and entertaining enough for its 2hr+ runtime to whizz by painlessly. Visually, the retro-futuristically designed production has much eye-catching details that's amusing, almost delightful even, and the special effects are decent (bar that one brief but embarrassingly bad Photoshopped shot of Bill Clinton). While the ubiquitous Giancarlo Esposito manages to provide heft and menace with a practically zoomed in performance, miscellaneous Oscar/Emmy winners/nominees pop in for blink-and-you'll-miss cameos and there's an A(or at least B)-list of voice-actors led by Woody Harrelson and Anthony Mackie assembled to give life to the CGI robots. Compared to similar outputs from other streamers led by superhero/franchise stars on hiatus in between sequels, this is undemanding, watchable and actually nicely put together. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's script ultimately holds itself together well enough in a pleasingly Amblin-esque manner, and had the film not been overshadowed by that antagonizing price tag of $300m and those Avengers-level expectations, perhaps it wouldn't, and shouldn't, be judged as harshly as it had by some."

It has a fun, fast-paced rhythm, straight out of the popcorn-movie playbook. It‚Äôs not going to win an Oscar‚Äînor is it trying to‚Äîbut I honestly enjoyed it way more than most of the films that usually get nominated for those monocle-wearing awards. I‚Äôm tired of reading negative reviews about Netflix‚Äôs latest movie. Most of them just can‚Äôt accept that something this expensive to produce is meant to be enjoyed. Some people hate CGI on principle, and others underestimate a great new-generation actress like Millie Bobby Brown. Is it the best movie of the year or one of the platform‚Äôs top titles? No. Is it a sci-fi film with a story that‚Äôs interesting enough for a broad audience, decently executed overall, and technically impressive? Yes, absolutely. For me, it‚Äôs a solid 7 out of 10. You can enjoy it at any time of day, with the whole family, and it‚Äôll still hit the mark. Was it expensive to make? Sure, but that‚Äôs actually a plus for the viewer, not a negative. Honestly, I hope they spend even more."

El costo no tiene que condicionar el visionado y me da la impresi√≥n que esta informaci√≥n y los antecedentes de los directores de pel√≠culas anteriores (Avengers Infinity War y Avengers Endgame) pusieron la vara muy alta a la hora de juzgar esta pel√≠cula, que mi entender, es buena, es entretenida, se deja ver y por momentos emociona. T√©cnicamente es perfecta y aunque el gui√≥n puede tener alg√∫n punto flojo, no entiendo el ensa√±amiento de la cr√≠tica con esta pel√≠cula. Yo recomiendo que la vean."

They forget what it was like to enjoy a movie as a kid or YA. When I watched it with this perspective ‚Äì which is to say, not critically ‚Äì the movie was fine. Chris Pratt playing Chris Pratt wasn't the more adventurous choice, and Millie Bobbie Brown playing a high schooler was an odd casting option. I got over it. Plot gimmicks and holes? Sure, but just sit back and enjoy the ride. It's not Oscar fare anyway. The '90s nostalgia alone was fun, though I admit that I think they were relying on this aspect to draw in more interest. The CGI was decent, too. If I were to rate this without this consideration, it might be a 2.5 or 3.0, so do yourself a favour, and shut off your brain for a couple hours."

The premise, source material, and budget are all solid, and yet there‚Äôs really not much to praise about this movie. That said, I‚Äôll start with what little I can: Visually, the movie looked pretty good. Not necessarily the cinematography, but the art design and effects. A huge part of that is because of the artwork of Simon Stalenhag that this movie is based on. That said, I have to give credit to the movie for sticking with the aesthetic and not trying to change what works. The other thing I can praise is the music. There were a few moments that *almost* made me feel something thanks entirely to the music. Unfortunately, the movie was a disaster in every other area. It has some of the worst dialogue and most obvious product placement I have ever seen. The story is close to being good, which somehow makes it worse when it falls short, and the actors are all clearly phoning it in for a paycheck (if they‚Äôre not, that‚Äôs even worse). The worst part of this movie is that you can tell they thought it was going to be really good. There are so many moments and lines that feel like they‚Äôre supposed to be heavy hitters, but it all falls flat. Honestly, this movie should be studied for how hard it fumbled"

Electric State based on a book and now turned into a movie is ok. I'd say not great but it's not bad also. Acting is ok. Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt do an ok job. What I liked was some of the robots and the flash back putting the movie in an alt 1980 - 1990 era. What kills the story is that there so much info in the movie and it feels rush. The character/world building is don't poorly. This just does not feel like a movie that so much money was put into it.

To perfectly describe The Electric State is to put the words mindless and entertaining in the same sentence. The movie offers an interesting twist on the dystopian genre by taking place in the 90s, creating a futuristic yet nostalgic world where humans and robots struggle to coexist. While this premise sounds exciting, it‚Äôs sadly not executed to its fullest potential. The acting is on par with Netflix productions considering how flat the characters are, and the visuals are heavily reliant on CGI as usual. The Electric State‚Äôs biggest advantage is that it‚Äôs fun to watch despite its many imperfections."

Electric Charge State: This refers to the condition or quantity of electric charge an object or particle possesses. Objects can have a positive, negative, or neutral electric charge, which determines how they interact with other charged objects. 2. Electric Field State: In physics, this might refer to the state of an electric field, describing the distribution and strength of the electric forces exerted by charged particles in a given area. 3. Electric Potential State: The state of electric potential or voltage at a point in space, related to the work required to move a unit charge from a reference point (usually infinity) to that point. 4. Electric State in Solid-State Physics: In the context of materials science or electronics, this could refer to the specific conditions or arrangement of electrons within a material, such as the energy state of electrons in a conductor or semiconductor.

However if you played this movie in the background of doing something you wouldn‚Äôt want to look up to see what‚Äôs happening. The plot is very predictable and contains many loopholes. I am a fan of the art book and I have to say this was a let down. The cgi was nice yet the plot couldn‚Äôt follow suit. I did enjoy watching this movie even though there were many negatives. I would recommend if you have free time and a love for robot movies. Just don‚Äôt expect it to be award winning."

It's thought provoking, but not too much so to make you bored. I'm not sure what the bad reviews are about, the acting is good, the pacing is fun, the story is interesting. And soundtrack is GREAT! VfX are amazing too. It's better than all the Marvel movies put together. It's a playful adventure, probably geared more toward kids but one that adults will still enjoy.

    "review": "\"The Electric State,\" directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, is a sci-fi adventure set in an alternate, retro-futuristic 1990s America. The film stars Millie Bobby Brown as Michelle, an orphaned teenager who embarks on a journey with a mysterious robot named Cosmo to find her long-lost brother. Along the way, they team up with Keats, a smuggler portrayed by Chris Pratt, and his wisecracking sidekick, navigating a dystopian landscape filled with the remnants of a high-tech consumerist society in decline. Visually, \"The Electric State\" is a spectacle. The filmmakers have crafted a vast, ruined world where gigantic battle drones litter the countryside, seamlessly blending live-action with CGI to bring this desolate landscape to life. The design of the robots, especially Cosmo, is both creative and evocative, reminiscent of the charm found in Pixar's \"WALL-E.\" These visual elements successfully transport the audience into the film's unique universe. However, the film's narrative struggles to match its visual prowess. The screenplay often falls into the trap of excessive exposition, particularly in the opening sequences that delve into the backstory of the war with machines. This approach tends to tell rather than show, hindering the audience's immersion. The pacing is another issue; scenes transition rapidly, with characters delivering lines at a breakneck speed, leaving little room for viewers to absorb the unfolding events. Millie Bobby Brown delivers a commendable performance as Michelle, capturing the character's determination and vulnerability. Chris Pratt's portrayal of Keats, however, feels somewhat one-dimensional, lacking the depth needed to make his character truly compelling. The supporting cast, including Stanley Tucci, Ke Huy Quan, and Giancarlo Esposito, add gravitas to the film, though their characters often feel underutilized. Thematically, \"The Electric State\" explores the ethics of robotics and the consequences of a high-tech society's decline. While these themes are timely and relevant, the film's execution lacks the nuance required to provoke deeper contemplation. The narrative's focus on action and spectacle often overshadows the philosophical questions it attempts to raise. Comparatively, the Russo brothers have previously demonstrated their ability to balance action and character development in films like \"Avengers: Endgame.\" However, \"The Electric State\" seems to prioritize visual spectacle over narrative depth, resulting in a less satisfying experience. The film's ambitious scope is evident, but it falls short of delivering the emotional resonance found in some of their earlier works. In conclusion, \"The Electric State\" is a bold endeavor that excels in visual artistry but falters in storytelling and character development. While it offers moments of spectacle and a few emotional beats, the overall experience feels underwhelming. For viewers seeking a visually immersive sci-fi adventure, it may suffice, but those looking for a more profound narrative may find it lacking."

It‚Äôs not a reboot or remake so I found it to be an enjoyable movie one that doesn‚Äôt need to be overanalyzed by these so-called Professional critics. I agree an enormous amount of money was spent on this which probably could‚Äôve been done for less, but they got a great set of actors and voice actors and the VFX was quite enjoyable. Yes, there were a few subpar moments but overall I give this a 10/10. It kept my attention and it makes me want to now read the source material. So I think the Russo Brothers did a great job and I would watch this movie again. The point of a movie is to provide an escape from the mundane and monotonous world we live in.

A great cast, renouned directors, amazing source material and apparently limitless budget. But oh dear what we got was about as basic as a vanilla ice cream, at best. Knowing the source material the film is pretty much just the visual asthetic of the book with basically none of its story which is a very grim tale told in a simple but very captivating way. What we get instead is a long winded, bizzarly goofy and not terribly interesting reinterpretation, that almost felt like it should have been a series, not a film. It trudges along in a very strange discombobulated way often not making sense or laying narrative framework that either doesn't pay off or is completely ignored, forgotten or worse doesn't land the way it was intended. I found myself bored with 20 minutes to go and asking, do I care about this journey anymore? These people, this plight? No, Not really. While I liked the characters in principle I didnt like the writing. Its far too hammy, and low hanging fruit in nature. It seems like they wrote it after they cast it, as if each line of dialogue was written for the person delivering the lines, and NOT for the character they are portraying. You have Millie Bobby Brown playing a character Millie always plays, and saying the things Millie always says. Shes, yet again the tragic yet virtuous girl boss who can do no wrong and sticks it to the man. (I love ya Mills but you gotta step outta that mold) Meanwhile Chris Pratt is another dithering hero, a whitless good guy with a heart of gold wrapped in a rough exterior, he's effectively another Starlord.... The supporting cast is okay but again fall into character type for each and every actor. Giancarlo Esposito plays who you'd expect, Anthony Mackey? Ditto. Even Ke Huy Qwan is exactly who you'd think he'd be. It's a film where every person in front of the camera or voicing a character was unashamedly typecast. Then theres the cost. Had this been a 50 million dollar movie I might let more slide but at 320 million? I cant help but ask where the money was spent. Sure the CG is good, but theres nothing special or jaw dropping about it and theres certainly nothing here thats 320 million dollars better then any of the CG seen in the Avengers movies or heck even Transformers. Then theres the costuming and practical effects which look very cheap and flimsy. Its an odd dichotomy visually that when it nails the books asthetic is quite striking but when it doesn't it really doesn't. In the end overall I'd give it a 2.5/5. Its the definition of mediocre. Not the worst thing ever in terms of a watching expierence but its easily the most expensive waste of potential you'll likely see in a while."

    "review": "This movie is great - really fun to watch! It is another example of how critics are so out of touch with what the general public enjoys in a movie. Sure there were some moments in the climactic scenes where I feel like the script faltered and didn't quite hit the mark or provide enough justification for some characters' actions. But those points were few and far between. Overall, this movie was so much fun to watch. The acting was stellar, the sci-fi caricature of an alternate 1990's was perfection, the well-timed comedic bits were exactly what was needed, and the story was heartfelt and as real as you could want, considering the source (a graphic novel). Any critic who panned this movie forgot what it's like to just enjoy a movie for what it is. It doesn't need to be an exact duplicate of the source, it needs to stand on its own. And this film does that. Enjoy the graphic novel for what it is, and enjoy this film separately for what it is. Both have merits in their own right. If you're looking for an enjoyable evening of cinema, give this one a chance. You won't be disappointed."

    "review": "\"The Electric State\" promised a visually stunning, emotionally resonant journey, but it delivered a muddled narrative and a surprisingly underwhelming performance from Millie Bobby Brown. While the film's aesthetic, admittedly, is a feast for the eyes, the story it attempts to tell is lost in a sea of visual effects and underdeveloped characters. Brown, who has proven her talent in other projects, feels miscast and surprisingly flat as the protagonist. Her portrayal of a young woman navigating a dystopian landscape lacks the necessary emotional depth and grit. There's a disconnect between the character's supposed desperation and Brown's often detached demeanor. The emotional weight of her quest feels manufactured, rather than genuinely felt. Her delivery of lines is often monotone, and the moments that should have been impactful fall flat due to a lack of genuine emotional investment. It's as if she's going through the motions, failing to connect with the character's internal struggles. The chemistry with her robotic companion, Skip, which should have been a central emotional anchor, is also surprisingly weak. The film's reliance on Brown's performance to carry the emotional weight ultimately backfires, leaving the audience feeling detached and uninvested. While the visual spectacle might entertain some, the film's core narrative and Brown's performance fail to deliver the emotional punch it so desperately needed.\""

Turning a stunning looking Graphic Novel, with deep philosophical meaning, in a depressing, yet, beautiful distopian world into a Marvel movie is the same as turning Lord of the Rings into a Romantic Comedy with Sandra Bullock. I bet the critics you guys say to ignore are least are aware of the source material. Everything else is just your typical Marvel comedy (let's be honest, Marvel movies are no longer action superhero movies): cheesy one-liners, goofy actiing, shallow massaging and poor storytelling. Warch it if you have the intelectual development of a 14 years old boy. If you are an adult with half of your brain operational, read the graphic novel or watch the Curious Archive video about it on YT. Much more deserving of merit"

Millie Bobby Brown didn't seem to display emotions well until some of the ending scenes. I don't regret watching it, however I don't think I'd rewatch it.

This is some of the best cgi work ever rendered. Corridor Crew is gonna love this. Who cares if it's a robot apocalypse trope? A lot of ppl like that, plus it's an adaption of an existing graphic novel? The hate seems so contrived. It's not a Mulholland Drive, or Red, Blue or even a White (all you Le cin√®ma du Gaullywood freaks know what I'm talking about) but it's a fine Spielberg clone that's full of some of the best graphic artistry in modern cinema. And I'm not really a fan of either of the two lead actors either, but with so much incredible CGI to oggle, I hardly let their average performances bother me.

We laughed the whole time and it was a fun night, thanks to Millie Bobby Brown & The Russos. Anybody who didnt like it, seriously just wants to crap on EVERYTHING! Im so tired of people these days. It's like nothing is ever good enough anymore, & everyone is both a critic and an amazing film maker. Electric State was hilarious and I will totally watch it again!, & if you want a silly movie with MBB, StarLord, cute robots and a fun adventure to watch with the wife and/or the kiddos (our kids were playing their video games, so my wife and I watched it together and loved it!) ....then Go Watch Electric State ü§ñ"

This movie is not just another apocalyptic tech takes over story. While the entirety of the story is greatly exaggerated, it is a great analogy of the world we live in today.

It‚Äôs not meant to be epic, or life altering, symbolic of deeper things. Although it does deal in foreseeable moral issues in the future. Or the loss of a family member in death. But It‚Äôs just a normal family movie!! If this was made in 1990 it would have been the most epic movie.

Em 1994, a guerra terminou com a vit√≥ria dos humanos, que usaram uma tecnologia desenvolvida por um cientista chamado Ethan Skate, que transfere a mente das pessoas para corpos eletr√¥nicos chamados de drones. Os rob√¥s foram exilados em uma Zona de Exce√ß√£o. E a empresa de Skate enriqueceu com sua tecnologia. √â quando Michelle descobre que a mente do seu irm√£o falecido est√° no corpo de um rob√¥ e ela decide ir at√© a Zona de Exce√ß√£o para descobrir a verdade, por√©m h√° uma conspira√ß√£o bem maior por tr√°s. Os anos 90 viraram os novos anos 80? √â meio estranho uma fic√ß√£o cient√≠fica com tantos conceitos inexistentes hoje em dia, passar durante a d√©cada de 90. Por que n√£o jogar para o futuro? S√≥ para aproveitar a trilha sonora? Depois dos Vingadores, os irm√£os Russo n√£o acertaram mais. E este filme segue os outros: uma bola na trave. Tinha os elementos certos, o elenco certo, mas algo n√£o me pegou. Chris Pratt faz mais uma c√≥pia do Starlord. Tucci e Esposito entregam os vil√µes que eles est√£o acostumados a fazer, com um p√© nas costas. Millie Bobby Brown n√£o acertou como protagonista como em Stranger Things. Talvez porque l√° existe uma qu√≠mica entre o elenco que lhe d√° o suporte necess√°rio. Aqui ela e Pratt n√£o combinaram. Ficou for√ßado o motivo pelo qual ele vai ajud√°-la, Na parte t√©cnica, o filme se sai bem (tamb√©m com um or√ßamento de US$ 320 milh√µes). Os efeitos visuais s√£o muito bons e mesclam bem o CGI com animatronics e outras t√©cnicas. The Electric State √© o filme que ficou no quase, sem um bom roteiro, que aproveitasse tudo o que a hist√≥ria proporcionaria."

It's like certain movies fall into this thing where it becomes popular to hate or love it and then the masses just go with that in order to fit in. This movie is 100% more entertaining than Wicked and yet they have the exact opposite reviews. (Wicked is an unbearable movie, with bad acting and CGI that drags) The Electric State has decent acting, pretty good CGI and a fine pace. Storyline and plot isn't complicated. The only thing is it feels like Ready Player One meets the MCU. If you go in wanting to hate any movie, odds are you will.
