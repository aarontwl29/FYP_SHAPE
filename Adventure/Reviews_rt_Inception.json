    "review": "I’ve always been late on watching the important or hype worth movies. Only 15 years late but have finally watched the original hype movie Inception. And it did not disappoint. The entire time the viewer is trying to put pieces together, looking for the small details to understand if they are awake or dreaming, what level of the dream they are on, or if it connects to a dream earlier in the movie. Love the undecided ending allowing people to create their own ending based on how they have interpreted the small details throughout. These kind of suspense mystery films, ones like Knives Onion, are underrated and need to be made more. The amount of interactivity they have with the viewer is unmatched. Another film the long arsenal of wonderful Nolan films."

It's a good film, I loved it, but the thing is: I only loved it for its 148 minutes, after that, little by little I forgot about it or started caring about other things. Inception didn't have the impact I would expect from the director named one of the best of our time, but it served up a feast of science fiction and action with the most beautiful formula."

    "review": "\"Inception\" is the first film I've seen by Christopher Nolan. Fifteen years ago, I was deeply impressed, and today—with a little more viewing experience—I still am. A key reason for this is probably my love of heist movies, and \"Inception\" is a very entertaining example of this genre. I also think the way the idea is implanted in Cillian Murphy's mind is very well done. And while Di Caprio's story bloats the film, it doesn't take the wind out of its sails. With a running time of almost three hours, I was never bored even after watching it for the fourth time. Why this particular film became one of the biggest pop cultural events of the 2010s, I can't explain. For me, it's the fascinating paradox of Nolan as a filmmaker: He always manages to squeeze a lot of money out of big studios for rather cerebral ideas, or rather, sell them to a mainstream audience. He shoots on film in the traditional way, using VFX only where necessary, and even occasionally letting a train drive through a crowded street. His scripts are almost over-engineered, so much so that when you watch the film, you notice its architecture; the characters often say unnatural things and/or regularly throw in such obvious exposition/explanations/etc. that even the last person in the theater understands what's happening and why. This allows you to follow the film without thinking too much and simply have a good time. Because, ultimately, I believe Nolan is all about creating emotions. In his very own, technocratic way. And that's also the reason why I've never understood why there are so many explainer videos about his films. What are they trying to explain to me about \"Inception\"? Whether the spinning top falls or not? That question still leaves me cold to this day."

    "review": "Christopher Nolan's \"Inception\" remains a cinematic paradox, a film whose brilliance is inextricably intertwined with its demanding nature. While my initial encounters left me somewhat adrift in its labyrinthine narrative, a subsequent, more contemplative engagement reveals a work of profound ambition and undeniable artistry, one that has indelibly reshaped the landscape of contemporary science fiction cinema. The film, however, does possess inherent hurdles to accessibility, a reality that necessitates a nuanced evaluation rather than outright dismissal. The narrative premise, a dream thief tasked with the audacious act of \"inception\" – planting an idea into a target's subconscious – is undeniably a stroke of conceptual genius. This sets the stage for a multi-layered exploration of consciousness, grief, and the porous boundaries between reality and the subjective realms of the mind. This concept alone is a testament to Nolan's audacious creativity. The initial, almost overwhelming, barrage of exposition, while undeniably a challenge, is arguably a necessary evil. We are, after all, thrust into a world with its own complex rules and terminology, and the protracted setup, though potentially alienating to some, serves to establish the intricate architecture of this dream-within-a-dream paradigm. The film's deliberate pacing in the first act, while begrudgingly turbulent, is analogous to the careful construction of a dream itself, where details are gradually revealed and the contours of the environment slowly solidify. The perceived chaos allows the audience to acclimatize to the film's unique syntax, which includes the rules of dream sharing, the dangers of projecting and the mechanics of time distortion in the dream world. The ensemble cast delivers satisfaction in each performance. Leonardo DiCaprio, as the haunted Dom Cobb, anchors the narrative with a raw emotional intensity. The subtle shifts in his demeanor, the weight of his past, and the yearning for reconciliation are palpable, grounding the fantastical elements in a frequently relatable human context. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as Arthur, Cobb's pragmatic \"point man,\" provides a compelling counterpoint, his stoicism serving as a bulwark against the swirling chaos. The other members of the team, each with their distinct skillset and personality, are equally well-defined. This depth of characterization ensures that the audience remains emotionally invested, even when the narrative descends into its most abstract and intellectually demanding regions. The technical achievements of \"Inception\" are nothing short of breathtaking. Nolan’s commitment to practical effects, a refreshing departure from the reliance on ubiquitous CGI, elevates the film to a new level of realism. The iconic sequence of the rotating hallway, the gravity-defying fight scenes, and the mind-bending cityscapes are a testament to Nolan's innovative approach and, frankly, his sheer technical prowess. The visual aesthetic is stunning, creating a world that is both surreal and grounded, a visual feast that lingers long after the credits roll. The seamless integration of these practical effects with the film's complex visual storytelling further enhances its impact. The third act, a symphony of intercut action sequences, showcases the payoff that was so laboriously created. It's an exercise in taut suspense, where the intricate plan finally comes to fruition. The choreography is impeccable, the editing is sharp, and the tension is unrelenting. Despite a minor degree of bloat in this final act, the adrenaline rush generated by the final sequence is undeniable. The film becomes a visual spectacle that rewards the viewer's undying patience. Though ultimately worthwhile, the extended runtime is not an investment to be taken absentmindedly. Despite this, the sustained climax is a testament to Nolan's mastery of cinematic storytelling. It's during this time, in the heat of the action, that the emotional stakes that were planted early on come into bloom, offering a truly immersive and affecting experience. Acknowledging the initial lukewarm reaction to \"Inception\", it is essential to concede the film's profound impact. The very fact that it provokes such intense debate, almost a decade after its release, speaks to its enduring power. Its influence can be seen in numerous subsequent films, the narrative structure of which it has undoubtedly influenced. \"Inception\" is a philosophical exploration, an exercise in scientific experimentation, and a cinematic achievement that will continue to fascinate and challenge audiences for years to come. The fact that it requires a certain degree of dedication to fully appreciate does not diminish its brilliance. Perhaps, to truly understand \"Inception\", one must enter it, not just watch it. And when one does, the rewards are immeasurable. While it remains a film that demands a conscious effort from its audience, its lasting legacy is undeniable and earns it's 68% score."

    "review": "A wildly creative high-concept action-packed thriller that starts off hazy with its complications, but quickly wins you over once the fog dies down and everything begins to make sense. It’s much like riding a roller coaster at night: you may not always know what’s going on, but you’re still having a fun time with the sheer absurdity of the situation that’s been expertly handcrafted just for your entertainment. Sometimes it can be hard to follow, but surprisingly I wasn’t as lost as I thought I’d be (probably helps that I didn’t watch it until 12 years after the movie came out). The main cast are all terrific and bounce off each other really well despite some tropey rocky starts at the beginning. The plot keeps on hooking you into its narrative with its creative visual set pieces that explore some pretty interesting and profound concepts about dreams, escapism, coping with grief, memory, re-memory, psychosis, and the subconscious. Despite all the memes and pale imitators, Hans Zimmers’ score is still amazing with its thrilling booming sense of urgency, with the trailer music being my favorite track despite not making an appearance in the movie itself. The set design and shift camera work are amazing and really lull the viewer into a dream-like state, much like the protagonists of the film. Mad props to the cast for being able to convincingly work off each other across different dream scenarios that are seamlessly edited to appear simultaneously. After all these years, I finally get why everyone was freaking out about the spinning top at the very end of the movie. It may give you a bit of a headache by the end, but Inception will give you more than enough cinematic creativity, gripping character drama, and intriguing philosophy to make you more than satisfied."

    "review": "This movie is paradoxical. On the hand, it has no right being as good as it is. On the other hand, it didn't reach its full potential. A lack of characterization for Mr.Cobbs really held this movie back. His motives were understandable, but they were presented in a very shallow way, to the point where I did not care about his subplot for the movie until the last 30 minutes. The character writing overall, was weak for every single character, and for most of this movie, there was no tention because the audience wasn't given well enough written characters to care about. Furthermore, I felt that the main plot(getting the business secrets), was not nearly as engaging as the subplot could have been(Cobbs resolving his guilt over planting an idea in his wife's mind that led to her suicide). That latter should have been the main plot, with the former being used as a subplot. It's really quite unfortunate that wasn't the case. That being said, this is a good movie, that both gets better as it goes along, does a good job making it's unique world very under stable to the audience, and most impressively of all, has near flawless pacing and FLAWLESS exposition. Hands down, this movie contains the best exposition I have ever seen. It's use of multiple characters as surrogates for the audience, asking question we want to ask but can't, exactly when they pop into our heads was perfect! This could easily have been a very confusing/boring movie, but thankfully, the exposition was done to perfection.The pacing was fantastic. Of the roughly 2 hour and 20 minute runtime, I only ever felt the movie drag for 6 minutes(right in the middle of the second act). THAT STUNNING. Now I did mention the movie getting better as it went along and it certainly did. The acting and the action was horrible for the first 35 minutes, but right around the 50 minute mark, they began to improve exponentially, and by the third act, both were flawless. Same goes for the cinematography. It went from bad in the first act, to decent in the second, to flawless in the third act. Do you notice a pattern? Every aspect of the movie becomes flawless by the third act. Which leads to my hypothesis, that the reason this movie is scene as a masterpiece, is because of its third act. Indeed, this movie has one of the greatest third acts of the 21st century, and Nolan's third best in his career in my humble opinion. By the third act, they finally graduate the subplot to the main plot, and vice versa, which is why this movie becomes so beautiful. By the end, I became invested in Cobb's story, and his motivations. They went from mediocre movie motivation writing, to captivating. And honestly, by the time the third act, and by extension the movie ended, I thought it was a solid 9/10. I immediately wanted to watch it again(and even as I write this, I still do). I became convinced that everything in this movie ended up working very well in the end, and it just took a while to unfold, but was it end, the end result was a cinematic masterpiece. However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized two things. 1. I had the same thought process as this movie's biggest fans- I fell so in love with the third act, that I re constructed this movie in my mind to be as phenomenal as the third act, which led me to elevating this movie's quality in my mind. 2. Once I realized this, I became conflicted. Was I disappointed? Not really. I thought going into this that it would be a good movie, with several flaws holding it back. That was exactly what I thought of it after thinking deeply after watching it. So was I satisfied? Not really, because I wanted my expectations to be subverted. But then again, disappointed wasn't the right word because this movie met my expectation perfectly. Definitionally speaking, I could not be disappointed. In the end, I realized the right word to describe how I felt about this movie was... frustrated. Frustrated because it would have just had slightly better character writing, this movie would have been a masterpiece. It would have been a 9/10, or maybe even a 10/10. The character writing really held this movie back, and I am giving it a lower score than I think it deserves. I do think this movie is overhyped, and people who disagree should watch this movie immediately after reading this, with my postulation in mind, and decide for themselves. I don't think this movie is bad, like it's haters like to say. I don't think it's a masterpiece, like it's lovers like to say. It's good, but not great."

Lots of ways to interpret things that happen in the film. Christopher Nolan clearly made parts ambiguous. The film can be confusing at times, but surprisingly, I feel that actually adds to the experience. The whole premise of Inception can be disorienting. I think it's okay if we feel that way at times. The score is PEAK Hans Zimmer craftsmanship! Truly brilliant! Inception is an experience for sure! And one that I'd highly recommend!"

All of his films are good, but I think that his best films were his first three before he got into action, this is the only movie that he made after Batman Begins that scales up with those. It's so complex and tense that it kept me enthralled for the entire film, and has a beautiful emotional core about grief and vulnerability. Leonardo DiCaprio does great as the second main character in a Christopher Nolan film named Cobb, and Inception probably contains Hans Zimmer's best score. Also, it's one of my favorite endings in a film. Inception is everything Nolan is trying to do in his other films at its best."

    "review": "The title of the film is \"Inception\". The director of this film is Christopher Nolan. The film consists of one part. The genres of this film are fantasy, thriller, action films. The film was shot all over the world, with director Christopher Nolan working with the cast and crew in Tokyo, the snow-capped mountains of Calgary, the exotic streets of Tangier, the picturesque corners of Paris, historic London and modern Los Angeles. The plot of the film is as follows: certain people called Cobb and Arthur are “extractors”, people who penetrate a person’s subconscious during sleep in order to obtain the information they need. The whole film is built around this. In my opinion, the acting in this film is excellent, each scene is very well revealed by the emotions of the actors. The picture on the screen turned out great, it looks very good, the special effects are also wonderful. I recommend watching this film because it has a deep and interesting plot. Everything becomes clear only towards the end of the film. The musical accompaniment in this film is wonderful, the music very well describes what is happening on the screen (I think this is because Hans Florian Zimmer was responsible for the musical accompaniment). I like this film for all of the above points."

Until two weeks ago, My friend came and asked me: \"Are you interested in movies about theory or science?\" I told him I really liked it and I also like action movies. So he recommended ‘Inception' to me and he invited me to watch it together. The plot of the movie is about stealing ideas through dreams. Dom Cobb, the man who founded the intelligence espionage team. He is the best at entering dreams and steal valuable secrets from the subconscious of the target who is asleep. One day Cobb and the team meets an influential Japanese businessman named Saito who will hire Cobb to go on some missions in exchange for his return to the country without guilt. But instead, he hires Cobb to steal some information inside his rival mind. The mission turned out to be the opposite. When he wanted Cobb and his team to implant an idea into the mind of the son of the owner of his rival company. But it seems the new mission isn't as easy as it seems. When everything doesn't go as planned. As a result, Cobb and his team face more and more dangers on each floor of their dreams. While watching, I was surprised by the film production. Whether it's the actors, the plot, the setting, or the story. This movie is very interesting. It's a sci-fi action movie. Suitable for people who like movies with unexpected plots. Can't guess anything. This movie will keep our brains working for 2 and a half hours because it has many complicated theories. But it's full of interest with an unbeatable plot and the concept of Lucid dream, the most intricate. And I think that in that era, Inception was a very cutting edge movie. Because time probably won't be able to do anything about it. Even I came to see it after the movie had been shown for ten years. I'm still amazed by the plot, visuals and sounds, or scenes that I don't think ten years ago anyone would have thought of something like this. I don't know how Nolan's brain came up with something like this. The part that enhances the movie to fulfill the imagination of the viewer very well is probably the CG and the most spectacular cinematography. Each scene was created through Nolan's detailed thought process. Such as the scenes of the dream collapsing, the folding city, or the dream from the first floor to the last floor all create excitement for me viewer very well. I think Inception is a pretty difficult movie to watch. Because it takes thinking about the whole thing. Think along the storylines and characters. You may have to watch it two or more times to understand and relate to the movie more. Although it may be difficult to understand at first. But I would recommend watching this movie. Lastly, for Nolan's films, I would definitely rank this one as my favorite of his. I really love this !"

Definitely a good film and for a 14 year old movie it was definitely more creative back than. And even now. Because Hollywood doesn't do stuff like this very often. The PG 13 rating though is a bit absurd . The movie should be rated r for it's violence and the back of the box doesn't tell u this but there's also language in this movie. Parents guide/ Christian perspective Violence : lots of punching and kicking . Several scenes of the bad guys shooting off a sniper rifle and shooting with guns scattered throughout this movie. Bits a pieces of blood shown but not very much . Probably to keep the PG 13 rating . Language: about 5 gds , hell and damn said throughout the movie .

Basically there are 4 stages to the dream here. Inception shows that a smart movie can still be considered a Summer Blockbuster instead of a mindless action film. The movie features an A list cast with a lot of Nolan familars like Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Michael Caine. Leo is of course the main lead here and he puts on a great performance of someone who is internally conflicted but is also trying to help his team pull off an impossible heist. Those that say this movie is to confusing or don’t understand need to pay attention more as Nolan pretty much plays everything out here to follow. Inception is a film that is meant to be experienced and will be considered a classic. Inception gets 5 stars out of 5."

La forma en la que juega con el tiempo, los suenos, no saber si es real o no. Increible, me encarine con los personajes, senti miedo cada vez que podian pasarles algo. Y ese final, hace un dia que vi la pelicula y aun no dejo de pensar en ese final. Odio los finales abiertos, pero a la vez los amo, una obra maestra. Ojo que si tiene en ciertas partes un CGI horrible pero me dejo sin palabras esta pelicula"

The concept of the plot is quite intriguing and the cleverly created sets leave a long lasting impression. The score is notable as well. But that's most there is artistically to the movie.

    "review": "Great moses, \"Inception\" is exhausting! Gotta be one of the most mind-wearing movies ever. There's SO MUCH to grab your attention and hold it and all the while throwing more details, more flipped script moments of it enfolding onto itself, and your eyes see dozens of objects and symbols, and emotionally push-pulling actions. The scenes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt fighting in the hall as the van goes off the road in the conscious world (or was it?), then as he goes on gatherung and ushering the bodies from room to room, and on, is spectacular filmmaking. And the music is there so much of the time, be it the tension building, rousing, sustaining of the orchestral compositions, or Edith Piaf (so brilliantly portrayed by the wonderful, gorgeous Marion Cotillard; here playing DiCaprio's wife Mal) serenading on force, it's a central and so effective presence. It's surprising, though, that a director as meticulous as Nolan would be okay with the sound mix where the Zimmer's music and other sound at times muffle the dialogue. But part of it is all the whispered, almost mubled dialogue at times. But the tight cast is marvelous. The themes are concepts are pulled off well. This is the inception of Cobb's new life home, letting go of Mal. I knew a 'Welcome home, Mr. Cobb' had to come at Customs. I also like the idea of key objects having such specific, significant meaning to us that they can center us or help us keep a grip on our reality. And yes, the film has some of the most remarkable, sensational visual & special effects (just cinematography in general), stunts, set decoration and art design ever. The production design is other level. But back to how exhausting it is. I should've seen it in a theater when it came out. Maybe I did. If so, I'm sure I nodded off for some time. It gets me every time I try to watch it. How much of it is subliminal, and how much is it that the movie is just SO MUCH? 3.8 stars"

    "review": "SPOILERS This film follows Cobb, a man who is payed to infiltrate peoples' subconscious through their dreams and extract information. He is hired by a man however to do the opposite, the impossible. To infiltrate a tycoon's subconscious and plant an idea instead of take one - known as inception. This movie shattered my comprehension and mind a million times over, and the more I try and work it out, the crazier it gets. How on earth does Chris Nolans brain work? How to you conceive this script from nothing? A story so intricate, intellectual, complex and layered that simply watching it is mind-bending, let alone writing it. The thought of sitting down and working through the labyrinth-like story and characters is incredible daunting. Every single facet of this film can be taken down a seemingly endless rabbit hole. Ive said this before, but now, truly, I can say: I have never seen anything like this. Nolan has pushed the boundaries of storytelling and how it doesn't necessarily have to be transparent for an audience to grasp onto it. There is a plethora of things I couldn't comprehend while watching - but it honestly never took away from the film in general. It was never too convoluted that I became overwhelmed and uninterested. Was I completely mind-broken, scratching my head the entire time, yes. But I still was able to focus on the plot point at hand and be insanely immersed. It struck an incredible balance of being complex, but still allowing the viewer to be immersed in the moment and not in thought. You don't have to understand the science and logic of it to have the watch of your life - vaguely understanding the labyrinth of layers and depth is kind of what makes it incredible. I can understand the scope and scale of what Nolan is doing, but I'm not going to sit down and map it all out. What a premise for a film, and what a delivery. Amid the spiderweb of subconscious and dreams within dreams, there is a character I grabbed onto and empathized with. Cobb is a broken widower, and it was fantastic learning about his trauma and wife piece by piece. We're guessing throughout at the entire picture of his past, but it is slowly, sometimes painfully unveiled to us with brilliant pacing. I was right there in those moments with Cobb as he opens up to Ariadne, or confronts his wife in the void. And the end, oh my god the end. He finally confronts his wife and the guilt he bears, giving us, the viewer, the final pieces of their story puzzle - catharsis man, catharsis. An incredible character and a heartbreaking story with high stakes attached, threatening to derail their mission. I really like what Cobbs story and the movie as a whole says in terms of our subconscious and trauma. Cobb suppressed his emotions and guilt for so long they threatened to consume him. Any mission he went on, anywhere he goes, he sees them. The memories and guilt threaten to derail his life at every turn. It is a beautiful sentiment toward these human emotions that so many people do not confront. Everyone carries baggage and trauma which they must come face-to-face with, then let go, in order to get back 'home'. I feel like themes such as this are why this movie succeeded beyond its complex story - at the core its a character piece about past love, hurt and loss, and how we deal with it. I only watched this last night, but I already know the ending will be engrained in my mind forever. It leaves a huge question asked all movie unanswered, and has a serious uncanny tone. I was so happy for Cobb at the end, but that emotion quickly subsided as I watched the spinner, wide eyed and teary. What a mismatch of feelings to give your viewer on the closing frame - absolute perfection. Overall, Inception is a film that cannot be replicated, and will forever be one of one. Outstanding Sci-fi premise, inconceivable narrative depth, and a character crafted with heart. Christopher Nolan, you genius."

A tragic one, but one none the less. Acting was top notch as expect from DiCaprio and the rest of the cast. Score was....some sounds that put you kind of in the mood for action on some somber time. Elliot Page Murdered (he did a great job, no joke. Maybe his best roll). But was it mind blowing? No. just a interesting enough love story. I'd recommend it"

I found myself not only invested in complicated nature of both extraction and inception, but also each individual's perception of reality. In talking about Inception, the perception is that it is either a masterpiece or one of the most over-rated and convoluted films in recent history. While I understand that the plot can be complicated and difficult to follow at times, I personally think that it is one of the best films of my generation. The story is unique, the acting is world-class, and the score powerfully sets the tone for the duration of the film. Christopher Nolan is an absolute genius, and I truly believe that he is changing the game for cinema."

In the case of Inception, the premise is interesting, the cast is impressive (Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elliot Page, etc.), and the special effects are periodically spectacular. However, as with a handful of his other movies, the story becomes convoluted beyond belief (it's a dream…within a dream…within a dream!!), resulting in the characters providing expository dialogue to explain the madness to the dumbfounded audience, giving the whole thing a condescending vibe. There is a kernel of a great idea here, but Nolan insists on ruining it by showing off his towering intellect. Thanks for nothing."

From the moment of the opening scenes, you are drawn into a world where reality and dream are blurred and separating the two is not straightforward. However, after a while everything becomes clear and it is easier to understand what is going on. That is, until the multi layered dream sequence starts. There are some inconsistencies, but overall, very entertaining. The whole premise behind the film is excellent but there is a lot of ambiguity. I would like to have seen more sophisticated storytelling in each layer. The snow scene just appears to have been action for the sake of itself, even though the outcome was vital to the plot. However, the final outcome of the dream sequence is never explained outside of a dream, so we never get to understand if it all paid off. We could go even further and say that we cannot even be sure that the whole thing from beginning to end was just a dream."

From what I understand, it took him a decade to write this story, and it shows.  In a time of endless adaptations, sequels, reboots and remakes, it's encouraging to see a filmmaker coming up with original stories. A masterpiece.

I have seen it 10 times (literally) and have still not gotten sick of it. Christopher Nolan can be described as nothing other than brilliant- absolutely, purely, enchantingly brilliant. His cinematography is always top-notch, but his plots are to die for. There is always something so alluring about his films. INCEPTION is a beautifully complex action-thriller about the art of transporting your consciousness into someone else's mind. You go into their dreams- their secrets are yours to discover- but it all comes at a cost, of course. This movie has some action scenes, some curse words- pretty acute swearing, and will lead you to question a lot of things. Nolan always has an all-star cast that never disappoints, and loves to use Hans Zimmer to do his soundtracks. Hans Zimmer is the perfect composer for Nolan movies- their individual arts of music and cinema combine, leading to a perfect, jaw-dropping movie. This movie will make you feel amazing; invincible. I must warn you, though, this is one of those movies that you have to really think about (Nolan's beautiful brain strikes again). \"What is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient, highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate.\" - Dom Cobb, Inception."

Speaking from personal enjoyment it’s a 10/10 for me but there are a few inconsistencies in the movie’s logic like the kick idea when (spoiler) apparently being in a car that falls off a bridge isn’t enough to wake you up but a chair tipping over immediately does the job. Also a bit weird that Saito is just able to wipe any charges from Cobb’s record or find him in Mombasa just before he gets caught by the people chasing him (though this may or may not be a dream sequence but even then, whose mind are they in at the moment?) I may have misremembered some of this as I haven’t seen the movie in a few months but I’ve seen it 3 or 4 times; like I said it’s one of my favorites but it admittedly has some flaws that some may be put off by. Tldr great movie with occasional plot armor to keep the story going, “objectively” speaking it’s a 9/10 for me but it’s the kind of movie I really like and am probably going to enjoy a bit more than most people no matter what."

The plot is so unique and awesome with this unexpected twist turn you never could have seen it coming. It feels so realistic, like it could really happen, because Nolan has done such a good job on creating Inception. The action is quite lame for a PG-13 movie, if I'm to be honest, but the whole big plot is so interesting why bother needing some action. I would have been just fine if there wasn't any action. It is such a breathtaking movie, and the breathtaking moments start from the very beginning. It is a bit confusing to follow, but they do go along and explain what is happening and what \"Inception\" is. The big twist when we learn that Cobb had already used Inception on his wife is shocking! I don't know about your opinions, but I believe Cobb is accountable for his wife's death -- even though he didn't physically kill her, he planted a dangerous idea to \"keep her safe\" which backfired to her committing suicide. The whole movie is breathtaking and superbly made. It is one of the most unique/original sci-fi films out there!"

Christopher Nolan, nos regala un mundo aunque muy complejo siempre interesante. Siempre con ese sello de calidad que este director posee. Donde aunque si te distraes le puedes perder la pista a la película, la misma se encarga de dejarte el desarrollo claro en escenas explicativas. El como los personajes se desarrollan en la trama es muy interesante. Teniendo el conflicto interno de cada uno de ellos expuesto en la trama, ya que la película se apoya de ellos para llegar al punto climático de la cinta, la película se basa completamente de las emociones de los personajes; ya sea como el personaje de Leonardo Di Caprio se embarca en esta película por recuperar a sus hijos o como el personaje de Ken Watanabe se embarca en un propósito igualmente personal; La estructura de esta película se hace fuerte en la profundización de personajes. Los efectos especiales de esta película me volaron la cabeza; solo cabe ver en detrás de cámara de la escena del pasillo para notar que estamos ante una película totalmente diferente. En esta película todos los involucrados pasaron a ser los mejores de la industria, se puede notar la dedicación que se le puso a esta película, ya sea en cosas notorias como las antes mencionadas o en pequeñas sutilezas en como esta estructurado cada escenario. Esta película a pesar de tener sub tramas que no terminan de cerrar, te lleva por un mundo muy interesante. Un mundo que no te deja de sorprender en cada acto de la película. Una historia con una estructura casi perfecta. Los recuerdos negativos tienden a opacar a los recuerdos positivos."

    "review": "Inception is a fantastic cinematic premise. And the special effects are some of the greatest ever seen in a movie. However, spectacular effects by themselves cannot make up for storyline or storey flaws. In addition, the storyline and tale have a number of flaws. One is the belief that companies are evil creatures vying for global dominion by snatching whatever they can from competitors. While this may be true for one or two tiny corporations, huge multinationals could never afford the negative publicity that such activities would generate, and hence it is not credible for over 99 percent of multinationals. Although DiCaprio is good, and the supporting cast gives it their all, the film falls short."

You are somehow brought among the characters and you feel their current anxiety. There are also some brilliant scenes which seem really charismatic, especially the ending when you really wonder, stare at the totem spinning, and try to understand whether this whole mission has succeeded or not. The only problem I had with this movie was unnatural occurrences, specifically the soldiers not reaching the protagonists, although there wasn't any rational inhibitor for them."

    "review": "In Christopher Nolan's climactic \"Inception\", Dominic Hobb, an expert dream thief specializing in corporate espionage, is given the possibility to return to his family as a reward for executing the seemingly impossible task of planting an idea into someone's mind. All the while, Hobb must battle the secrets that lie beneath his own subconscious. Honestly, I was expecting much more from this film. But it took me around 10 tries to sit through its entirety. Not only is Inception's runtime bulky, we aren't introduced to all of our key characters until around the 50-minute mark and it takes 90 minutes for the epic plan to take motion. You kind of have to watch it with company in order to stay hooked. Your viewing buddy will have to keep you focused, because it is far too easy to get drowned in what feels like a clunky, massive information dump (in the first act). The excess exposition bogs down the pace of the story, which is so difficult to follow with all of the dreams inside of dreams inside of dreams… The talented cast gave sterling performances, with Gordon-Levitt being my personal favorite. The best thing about Inception's editing and cinematography is that a great deal of the visual effects were shot practically and were admittedly stunning. And while the third act is a bit drawn out, it is undeniably the best part of the film. The intercut action sequences feel a bit more cohesive. It was great to see the team in action rather than the team in talking. To say the least, Inception is WAY overhyped, has an acquired taste, and did not exceed my expectations. In true Christopher Nolan fashion, this movie comes with an avalanche of too much exposition to stick to your brain that comes hurling at you at a snail's speed. But when it hits you, and destroys everything in sight, it's something to see… I guess. 68%."

It is wrong to drug people and them mind r@pe them as they lay unconscious and helpless. It is better to institute and enforce anti-trust laws that would break up large giants like Google and Amazon. We can't have economic freedom without bodily autonomy and basic civil liberties as well as a government that enforces those liberties. Kidnapping Fischer was a vicious, cowardly and morally bankrupt and not the work of a hero. I disliked the character so much I didn't care what happened to them so the movie was boring as well. The fact this ham fisted, pedantic and desultory film is supposed to be \"intelligent\" is particularly disturbing. Imagine a future where computer nerds rule the world by forcibly kidnapping us and then implanting \"good\" ideas into our brains and those of our children to make sure we do the \"right\" thing. Would you care if one of those nerds got killed going too \"deep\" into your brain while you lay unconscious and helpless? That is the way I felt watching Fischer's kidnapping."

Then I watched it again and appreciated the extremely impressive elements of it much more. The directing talent from Christopher Nolan is truly remarkable and the special effects/CGI is great. The action scenes especially in the middle of the film were my favorite parts, plus the ending scene. Not to mention the cast of actors that they were able to have participate in the production, very noteworthy. The film does have some issues though that may alienate some viewers. Much of the phenomenon in the movie is left up to a lot of interpretation and can make your mind too blown while you're still trying to keep up with the plot. It can be a lot to take in all at once and confuse people who aren't used to a movie like this. Plus I think that the romance between Cobb and Mal bogged down the main mission of the team a little too much, but I still see why something like that was included. Overall a pretty good movie! There is a lot to say about this movie and many ways to analyze it and that's why it was popular I guess!"

    "review": "A perfectly paced, written and directed story that will send your mind to an endless pondering and mesmerising journey. Nolan really knows what he's doing when it comes fiction. He knows how to deliberately lose the audience's comprehension to then retrieve it with magnificence. What truly makes Nolan's famous fiction movie Inception a masterpiece of time and reality mayhem, is the way the story is written and developed. It starts with a pretty strenuous concept: the inception of dreams. But then, as the story unwraps, with well-pace actions, embracing dialogues and great characters dissections, we begin to fathom what this concept of infiltrating dreams can serve for, alongside how it actually works – using great insight of true physics and thorough studies upon the very subject of dreams and time. All leading to an ending that wraps into this \"open ways\" notion. The casting is straight up perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio embraced the role of Dom Cobb as a professional, really diving into the trauma of the protagonist and exploiting the pain and adventurous errands that this character went through in his past. Tom Hardy nailed the role of the Eames, a character capable of impersonating others within one's dream, using his seriousness and his passionate sheer acting. Cillian Murphy, managed to play the role of a broken son left with the legacy of his dead father like a boss, using his prowess acting and his bewitching voice. And last, but not least, Eliott Page, who really knows how to do her job and create an emotional and interesting character, Ariadne, ready to help her team as the ingenious architect of dreams. I could spend a day writing about the story and how the cast, the full cast, is perfectly chosen, but I think the points I've given are enough to catch your attention – without spoiling the whole narrative – if you haven't seen the movie yet."

There are some hiccups like; The character \"Ariadne\" who's only purpose is to answer questions which then get answered by another character. This doesn't ruin the pace of the movie but it feels like a little disconnect. Because every other character in the movie knows exactly what's going on except when they haven't been informed about the job (which then is very obvious they would have questions). Nothing of this ruin the movie but bring it down from the \"Masterpiece\" title. The meaning and understanding of the movie are though very hard to get. The whole movie has two very straight forward and simple goals : Plant the idea of splitting up Robert Fishers' father's empire which will then give Cobb safety to go home to his kids. But there is a lot more to understand about the movie (which I will not go in-depth to in this review). The choreography is amazing. It's seem less to watch the fight-scenes. And it really looks like it would be in a dream. Writing is excellent and it awws me every time that it took around ten years to write the movie. All of this ads up to a excellent, re-watchable movie which I would recommend to anybody !"

The combined brilliance of the score by Hans Zimmer (perhaps the best score in cinema history), the directing by Christopher Nolan and the acting by the entire cast created this emotional masterpiece. It questions the very reality we live in and where we go when we dream. Scenes such as the father-son scene with Cillian Murphy are so full of emotion and the timing of each shot has you hanging on the edge of your seat in suspense. So I fully recommend this film to everyone although it may take a couple of viewings to truly give it justice."

    "review": "I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to \"The Dark Knight\", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before. Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film \"Paprika\" in the whole \"invading dreams\" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level. Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (\"G.I. Joe\", \"Transformers\") or the exact opposite (\"Doubt\", \"Invictus\"). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability. Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where \"Inception\" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years. Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (\"Avatar\" be damned). Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort \"Shutter Island\". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own. Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (\"The Dark Knight\"). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year. Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And \"Inception\" can proudly stand alongside \"Blade Runner\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether. There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people. Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime."

I love puzzling movies especially when you understand and everyone around you don't... So it is my type of film. The only problem with this is that characters like Arthur are just here to expose the story or fighting. But, the fight scenes are absolutely amazing. The physic laws in which the characters are during their fights are coherent and absolutely making the fights brilliant. Hans Zimmer is, as always, doing an amazing job on the music even if there is literally always music. The actors were really good, especially Cilian Murphy and Leonardo Di Caprio. Overall, it was a really good movie, but it had a lot of flaws. But, it's a great movie you need to see in your life."

Like The Matrix, most of the action takes place in the realm of dreams, but they seem completely life-like: the chases, the crashes, the explosions, the extractions, the interrogations, the heartbreak, the longing, the despair. Leonardo is in stellar form, scoring another high after Shutter Island. A special word for cinematographer Wally Pfister who juxtaposes the real and the surreal with such finesse, you never do get confused and always remain aware of the slippery ground you are treading on. Go, get intrigued and push the boundaries of your mind."

    "review": "Inception - 10/10. If Memento introduced the world to Christopher Nolan, and The Dark Knight elevated his career to becoming one of the biggest directors, then Inception catapulted Nolan into a league of his own. Inception has become everyones favourite \"confusing\" film (to be honest, the movie is pretty straightforward if you pay your full attention towards it). The film, which was being promoted as an action thriller, was so much more than that. There was the iconic action sequences of course, but there also was an amazing emotional quotient to the film. The film is also pretty interesting to think about, because technically Leonardo DiCaprio's Don Cobb could be considered the bad guy as he alters the thought process of Cillian Murphy's businessman character in order to allow Ken Watanabe to succeed in his ventures. Also, the movie doesn't have a direct antagonist if you think about it. Watanabe and Marion Cotillard are presented as possible villains, but they're not necessarily evil incarnate. Both have specific motives which are not specifically evil. Cotillard's character in particular is very layered, and we see that even though we as the viewer might see her as a villain, she has Cobb as a reason why she acts and thinks the way she does. But what Nolan made possible with Inception was one thing in particular, \"smart blockbuster.\" He helped prove to studios that creating a huge movie with incredible depth could be financially and critically successful. Not only have directors and studios over the years referenced or tried to make the next Inception type film, but we've also seen these big films try to make spectacle work in throwback ways. Like the majority of his films, most of the big stuff was done on set and in camera, allowing the viewer to really sense how real the production values are. But the biggest success of this movie is probably the fact it is still being talked about to this day. Some movies are forgotten within months, but Inception has been a talking point for cinema goers for years now. And the answer to the final scene: Cobb is in reality. Not only is not wearing his ring, but the top never wobbles in the dream."

    "review": "I learnt about this movie from Varun Dhawan's interview, where he said that Dilwale is like Inception. Everyone was mocking him and I didn't know why. And so I decided to check this movie out. And now I have literally no idea what he was smoking. This movie is a masterpiece even by Hollywood standards. It will continue to be known as an iconic movie for generations to come. The story is based on Cobb, a thief who uses people's dreams to to learn about their secrets and then uses them to steal from them. Because of the movie's title I thought that the entire movie is taking place in a dream and when they are actually shown to go in a dream it is supposed to be an inception. It was only after I read about it on Wikipedia that I understood that the main movie is taking place outside of dreams. Christopher Nolan did the absolute right thing by using practical effects instead of CGI. And it was also a pretty genius move to show your dreams that can actually happen in reality. Although many of the dreams shown in the movie look more like James bond films instead of actual dreams, I wouldn't just on that perspective since this is a subjective idea. Most probably many people have such kinds of dreams and they were the ones who were kept in mind when writing the story. But overall this was a great idea since the whole idea is that Cobb steals from the dreams of people and they would not realise that it is a dream only if it is made to be shown as realistic as possible. The characters have also been explored very well. Cobb's wife used to be his partner in crime, but after a while she got so much addicted to the inception machine that she started thinking that the real life is also a dream and thus she committed suicide thinking that she will be able to meet cob in his real life. Cobb has been holding himself responsible for his wife's death and does wants a chance to correct his mistake. He has recruited a college student learning architecture and that provides a good way to give exposition without making it look either forced or confusing. The only problem I had with this movie was the amount of talking that happens. In every scene there is talking, talking and even more talking, whether it is the the real world scenes or the dreamscapes. It was really boring to see them talk in a movie that is supposed to be about going into other people's dreams and stealing their knowledge and memories. The amount of exposition also seemed unnecessary and it felt like it was only meant to explain the people who are very slow to understand. But other than that I didn't have any problem. Overall I would say that Inception is one of those movies which define the decade as well as the the potential of Christopher Nolan's storytelling. This movie is a perfect blend of looking legendary and having mostly used practical effects. I considered to be the best Christopher Nolan movie after The Dark Knight."

It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. before seeing the film I read that the director was Christopher Nolan and the protagonist Leonardo Di caprio, so I already knew it was wonderful. without spoilers I want to make you understand a bit of what it's about; is an action and thriller film, lasting 2 hours and 28 minutes. Talks about Dominic Cobb is a professional who takes care of extracting secrets from people's minds while they sleep, infiltrating their dreams through a special device that allows a group to participate in a \"shared dream\". Cobb and his team normally use tricks and deceptions to steal information from the victim, who he believes to be in reality and suspects nothing. Together with his partner Arthur tries to enter the mind of Mr. Saito, a powerful Japanese businessman, to perform an extraction, but fails when the dream projection of Mal, dead wife of Cobb, appears in the dream interfering with the operation. I advise you to look at it very carefully, otherwise, you will not understand the ending well. I think it is one of the best films of 2013, because it differs from the others, it is not monotonous in the plot and you can see that the director has perfected every detail in order to make it fascinating and moving. I wait for you to see it and leave a personal comment."

Why do we dream 'faster'? etc.. but those things are kind of marginal to the plot as it rips along. If I had a major quibble, I guess I am not really sure who the 'good guys' are here, and Leonardo, while a competent actor, is not likeable. But then, maybe that is what they were going for here."

The first time that I watched it, which was long ago, I remembered not getting the full story, so I didn't think it was a masterpiece, although I did like it. However, this time was quite different. I was hooked right away within the opening scene, which showed the dream within a dream sequence that introduced the premise very well. Then, as the characters showed more about the movie's universe, I was so amazed with the cinematography, like the scene where the dream world was flip into half up and down. The story itself was complicated and required me to stay focused. Since I got some memories of when I first watched the movie, I did not struggle too much to fully grasp what was going on. This was for sure not as complicated as Tenet. With the story, Nolan dived into the human subconscious and applied the Freudian psychology. Overall, a total blast for the whole 2.5 hours. This is definitely one of Nolan's best masterpieces. 9.5/10"

The level of complexity in the plot, the attention to detail, the clear and wise cinematography choices with differing color palettes and excellent camera angles, and the sheer ambition to pull off a film of this magnitude are all breathtaking and leave me with a sense of reverence for Nolan. The issue I had was that he went out of his way to introduce elements to make the team's path to success more difficult but did so in an unfortunate way, having his main character thoughtlessly insist on imperiling the mission when plenty of alternatives existed for relaying to Eames the shortcut and explaining away the added danger of sedation by basically making it a magical sedative that only leaves you in mortal danger within the dream but will still let you wake up if kicked. Surely with some proofreading or outside notes these could've been handled more carefully and we would've been left with an absolute timeless masterpiece. Alas, we are left with only a fantastically good movie instead."

Then, of course, someone in a dream can go to sleep and create another dream level. When someone gets killed in a dream they wake up into the next higher level. But for some reason another twist is added whereby the dreamer sometimes does not wake up but ends up trapped in a place called ‘limbo'. Don't ask me why. Of course, after a while you lose track of the dreams and their levels. If you can stand all this then go ahead and see the movie. I myself did not find one minute interesting."

The concept itself is interesting enough to deserve its own franchise, but Inception keeps the plot tight enough to tell an exciting, dramatic, action-packed story. The special effects have aged wonderfully and the cinematography is impressive and intentional - each level of the final dream sequence has its own color scheme and uniquities which helped to keep the story clear and concise. On my first viewing, I felt like this movie was far more clever than I was, constantly twisting and turning and keeping some secrets stashed for just the right moment. However, on a subsequent viewing, I realized the plot isn't quite as neat as I originally thought - there are a few points that are never really addressed, along with some plot holes and general glossings-over. Inception does a good job at keeping the disbelief suspended with its engaging performances and impressive set pieces, but it ultimately could have been a little better within even just a hand-waving explanation of some of the more obvious contradictions."
