It's not cause it's a alter classic for generations but Modern Disney is been a coward for thinking the live action movie will make them more money like with Alice in Wonderland (2010) or The Lion King Live Action. Idk what are they thinking in their heads but clearly they need to get that thoughts out of their heads and make something much more adventurous and emotional and even magical like they have done in the good old day......But I guess it's the future so I guess we need to change but we don't have to change cause we are proud of what we are on the inside. We are perfect just being us. We can only hope that Disney will finally open their eyes and see what they are doing wrong and try to be the Disney we all know and love. But until then Snow White (2025) is by far the absolute worst Disney Live Action of all time and yes it's even worse than Pinocchio (2022) because at least this movie was laughably bad. This one has nothing there is nothing to enjoy here. So I'm not watching this garbage and either should you."

This could have been so great, but wtf was anyone thinking casting zegler as snow white? really? If I wanted to watch a couple of hours of forced acting from a bitter female there's plenty of protests here in Austin I can go watch, they're loaded with them. I was so sad and disappointed by this movie, it was uninspired, politically motivated drivel and why would have it been the end of the world if they just stuck with the original story and hired little people to boot? \"magical creatures\"? omg. There's a reason this thing has turned into a debacle, it's not even a cool bad, it's just bad. \"Bad\" movies from previous generations sometimes wind up gaining a cult following, I think this thing will be epically forgettable in the future, I'd be surprised if it even gets released on bluray or anything as judging from the numbers I can't think of a single person who left the theater wanting to ever see it again."

This fresh take on the beloved classic managed to capture the essence of the original while breathing new life into the story for today's audience. The filmmakers made thoughtful updates to the narrative that diverge from the 1937 animated version, but these changes served the story well rather than detracting from it. The visual effects were stunning, creating a magical world that had both of us mesmerized from beginning to end. The costume design and set pieces paid beautiful homage to the original while adding contemporary flair. What impressed me most was how the film maintained the heart of Snow White's journey while adding more depth to her character. The relationship between Snow White and the dwarfs was portrayed with warmth and humor that had my granddaughter giggling throughout. Meanwhile, the antagonist brought a compelling and nuanced performance to the screen. The music deserves special mention ‚Äì the score complemented pivotal moments perfectly, and the reimagined versions of classic songs struck just the right balance between nostalgia and innovation. Perhaps most importantly, the film delivered a satisfying conclusion that left us both smiling as we left the theater. It's a reminder that sometimes it's best to experience art with fresh eyes rather than being swayed by critics. This multigenerational appeal is exactly what makes Disney's new Snow White a triumph ‚Äì it created a precious memory for my granddaughter and me that we'll cherish for years to come."

Hearing the same handful of songs on repeat quickly turns what should be show‚Äëstopping moments into palate‚Äëwashers. What struck me most was how drastically they reworked everything from the original‚Äîexcept the costumes, which look like they belong on Broadway, not in a live‚Äëaction movie. It‚Äôs a weird mash‚Äëup that robs the film of any real momentum or atmosphere. Worst of all, the heart of the story is missing. The original‚Äôs sweet, earnest romance? Gone. In its place are hollow gestures that never build the kind of chemistry you want to see in a love story.

However, despite the re-casting; I actually really enjoyed this film, it's also worth noting I'm not someone who's a Disney Stan, I will and have criticised Disney in the past to friends and family, but this film while it does indeed have its problems. Mainly for me the uncanny valley nature of a lot of the CGI, as well as what felt like a TV series level of VFX budget regarding the mirror on the wall and the clouds of smoke surrounding the evil queen when the clouds swirl around her. Rather than feeling grand and spectacular, it fell small and underwhelming if I'm being critical. However, despite all of that I did leave the cinema smiling and the film also made me feel what it wanted me to feel. I actually had tears in my eyes during some of the scenes in this film, especially when we see Snow White being mourned and ultimately that's exactly what a movie is supposed to do; make you feel something! Does this film have issues? Yes. Would I have preferred to have real dwarf actors and not CGI creations? Yes. Does re-casting snow white to not have \"skin as white as snow\" cause an issue to the telling of the story? No. Honestly it doesn't. Now, while the reason give for the name in universe honestly feels very poorly written, clearly Disney were hoping to inspire a new generation and they were never trying to please those who saw the original and that's why I'd say there are a lot of people who need to take off their rose tinted spectacles and acknowledge it for what it is.

The only character or cast member that didn‚Äôt hold their own on the singing side was Gal Gadot. I think if you take the politics out of it, and you take away the fact that most people are hating on Disney right now because of them trying to match the current political scheme and speak to the younger viewers or follow the current culture of people under 20 then you‚Äôll realize what‚Äôs left is a good film with some poor choices. The over 40 people who are all bent on tearing it down. Need to remember that it‚Äôs not for them. They already had their snow White when they were children growing up and their expectation of a recreation of a movie that had its own issues needs to be kept in check, it‚Äôs just an outdated expectation of an nostalgic memory that they share from being little children. I was one of those little children I‚Äôm over 50 I get it but at the same time I can appreciate what happens and how things progress It probably should‚Äôve been remade a long time ago to avoid this.

    "review": "A nova vers√£o de Branca de Neve (2025) √© um desastre anunciado que cumpre todas as previs√µes pessimistas. Desde o momento em que a Disney decidiu reescrever sua pr√≥pria hist√≥ria, removendo elementos cl√°ssicos e personagens ic√¥nicos, o filme perdeu sua identidade. A protagonista parece desconectada da ess√™ncia do conto original, transformando uma jornada de autodescoberta em um manifesto gen√©rico e sem alma. A aus√™ncia dos sete an√µes, substitu√≠dos por um grupo aleat√≥rio de personagens de CGI, elimina um dos aspectos mais ic√¥nicos da trama. Al√©m disso, a falta de um Pr√≠ncipe ou qualquer constru√ß√£o convincente de romance faz com que a hist√≥ria perca seu encanto atemporal. Visualmente, o filme at√© tenta impressionar, mas os efeitos especiais s√£o inconsistentes e o design de produ√ß√£o carece da magia e do capricho que tornaram as anima√ß√µes cl√°ssicas inesquec√≠veis. A trilha sonora √© esquec√≠vel, e as novas can√ß√µes n√£o chegam perto do impacto das originais. No fim, Branca de Neve (2025) parece mais um projeto preocupado em se distanciar do passado do que em contar uma boa hist√≥ria. O resultado? Um filme morno, sem carisma e facilmente esquec√≠vel."

It's also worth noting there were around 15 kids under 12 in the showing I went to.

Every line delivery felt forced, every facial expression looked like she was either confused or bored. She completely sucked the life out of what should have been a charismatic, complex villain. The Evil Queen is supposed to be captivating, terrifying, and iconic ‚Äî instead, we got a bland, one-dimensional caricature. It‚Äôs like Gadot walked on set, read her lines off a cue card, and left. No presence, no intensity, just a big nothing. I‚Äôve seen better acting in high school plays. Honestly, she dragged the entire film down with her. A great villain can elevate a fairy tale ‚Äî here, it just buried it. Total waste of potential. If this is what Disney thinks is star power, they seriously need a reality check."

    "review": "Disney's Snow White or simply Snow White, is a 2025 American musical fantasy film directed by Marc Webb and produced by Marc Platt Productions for Walt Disney Pictures. It is a live-action reimagining of Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which was based on the 1812 fairy tale \"Snow White\" by the Brothers Grimm. The film stars Rachel Zegler as the title character Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen and Andrew Burnap as Jonathan, a rogue bandit. Prior to its release, the film generated significant controversy regarding its color-blind casting, changes to the story and the reimagining of the Seven Dwarfs. Additional backlash stemmed from lead actress Zegler's public critiques of the original film and her political views. As lame as it got, the title also had been changed a third time. It has grossed $183.4 million worldwide. With a production budget of $270 million, it is one of Disney's most expensive films and flops. Vision wrote: \"the film was visually disappointing. Eye gouging. The dwarves and animals were upsetting to watch. Sad. The actress was not convincing at all. The story was disastrous. It looked as if it was rewritten several times. They should have let the project and the actress burn in the fires of Tinseltown instead of releasing it. The only thing promising form the film was the immersive music and sound. One fry and nothing more.\""

Of all the Snow White spinoff films in recent cinema, this one is by far my favorite. I have a pretty fond place in my heart for Snow White in knowing the impact of the original film at the time of its release- it was my Grannys favorite, and shed put it on whenever wed make the two-day drive to her house. Realizing that she was 8 when the original came out in theaters, I understand why it was so special to her as well. When I saw the metacritic score around 40, it lowered my expectations a bit. After seeing the movie, I actually just felt annoyed by the critical reviews, because I felt like this movie deserved a much warmer reception. If you have any affection for original Disney movies, I think youll appreciate this movie."

    "review": "I was reaching for a replica of the amazing original Snow White movie. But, I guess they didn't aim the arrow for that! Let's start out with the positive. I liked how they added backstory for Snow White, and the ending gave a nice moral to not be vain, and stuck up as that will perish you. And the scenes(background), were really great in my opinion. I also thought the part where Snow White was scared running in the woods was really accurate to the original movie. It was great seeing it (not great, she was scared but you get the point). However, I don't get the ending when everyone dressed in white. I should have been colorful! Onto the bad parts. Snow White, is not the caring girl we know and love. She is much more serious. She doesn't talk to the creatures, like she used to in the most whimsical way. They should've had a lot more interactions, and I was so sad they didn't! They also needed more time with the dwarves! The dwarves were pretty corny. But, I really had a problem with DOPEY! First of all, WHY DOES HE HAVE HAIR? He's supposed to be bald ( don't laugh )! He is NOT supposed to be self-concious! I really wish they hadn't :( ! It brought so much LESS funniness to the film because of his negative thoughts. He needs to be happy to be himself! And him actually being able to speak, but didn't have enough courage to? Nope! Dopey being able to speak at the end, wasn't heart lifting, at least for me. I wished we had the scene where the dwarves are afraid of who is in their house. Also they should have introduced the dwarves with Snow White guessing, that was really good! But, instead they were introduced in incorrect alphabetical order. They tried to make it less boring with Happy suggesting to introduce them by the size of their toes. Also I DID NOT like the SONGS! I mean they had two originals, but they remixed it and did it poorly. (That sounds mean, but still). \"Hi Ho\" was too corny. And \"Whistle While You Work\" with the dwarves NO THANK YOU! The animals cleaning up was funny, and much better! And, it was corny. And the new songs aren't good either. A common theme is having hope&bravery \"With a Smile and A Song\" fits perfectly into it! However, they did not add it. It would fit perfectly. The dwarves washing song was som wonderful (this was left out), and I love how they cleaned Grumpy up! This was unfortunatly missing! Also the Evil Queen wastes time to send her soldiers in the woods to find Snow White. They then report a bit more physific location. But, honestly if the Evil Queen just got the info from the Magic Mirror, it would be less time consuming. I don't like the \"Prince\" so much, just because it's kind of copying Flynn Ryder (from Tangled). Snow White and the \"Prince\" are kind of like the couple of Rapunzel and Flynn Ryder. I like that couple, but the fact that they copied it? Sorry. I also feel like the \"Prince\" should actually be a Prince. Like maybe they could have made him a Prince in disguise. I don't know, just an idea to throw in there. The \"Prince\" was the substitute for the animals and dwarves. We had a LOT more scenes with him in it. Some people don't like how in the original Snow White marries a dude that she meets for 5 minutes. I never really thought about that much, until some of my family members brought it up. The plot revolves around that detail, trying to fix it. Maybe they could of added it in the backstory, though. They could of loved each other since they were young, and finally married. How they tried to fix it, changing the characters, the plot, adding characters, changing songs, adding and removing songs, lost the original movie we know and love. The original is just WAY better! I have spoken my mind, and given the review this movie deserves."

    "review": "This was a terrible project, I'm not even sure how the production team thought this was good enough to put out. Putting aside all the horrible CGI, some of the scenes do look vibrant and magical. The Dwarfs (who are iconic loveable characters) look creepy and out of place among the live cast. Speaking of the cast, let's move on to them. The only one who was a positive light was the not-a-prince, prince. Who DOES in fact save the princess by taking an arrow for her, and then waking her from the poison apple with a kiss. Making him more of a Robin Hood rebellion leader instead of a prince is an unnecessary, but fine change to the story. That doesn't change the story line too much, but what's wrong with having a prince as a love interest? There was no chemistry between the characters which really made the acting seem more like satire. Rachel has no respect for Snow White and it shows on screen. Snow White is feminine, pure of heart, and finds her inner strength from her kindness and love for others. She does not need to be loud, bold and patronizing, which I think the writers forgot and also shows in the music. It doesn't seem like it was meant for Snow White, but more for Encanto or Wish. Disney needs to remember where their foundation is and raise their standards back up. This is a fairytale meant to inspire with hope and love and show that inner beauty is stronger and more important than outer beauty, this is why she is the fairest of them all, not because she knows how to share apples and cherries. The symbolism of her wishing for love is actually important to show how unloved and mistreated she was living with her step mother. She was hoping and dreaming for compassion and human connection, isn't that something we all can relate to? That doesn't make her a weak character, it makes her a relatable teenager, which she was. That doesn't translate with Rachel's portrayal. Overall, don't waste your time on this movie, you'll never get that time back."

I think most of the other actors (except Gal Gadot) also did the best with what they were provided from a really thin script. Most of this movie is really undercooked. The romance was rushed, Snow White‚Äôs motivation was unclear (she wants to be a leader, but she already IS a leader through most of the movie? She guides the other characters and has little struggle taking on that role) The Evil Queen is mad because she‚Äôs not considered the prettiest when‚Ä¶.that doesn‚Äôt matter to literally anybody in this movie? Some motivations are very blurry. The CGI Dwarves? Gross. Just appalling. Some scenes are so rushed, like with the Hunstman? That was so anticlimactic and did not have near as much intensity as the original. In the original, Snow White is fearing for her life and crying, and still forgives the Huntsman. But here, she‚Äôs not? Hello! He‚Äôs threatening to stab you with a knife! Again, Snow White wants to be brave and such like her parents told her and she already IS. There‚Äôs no Journey or arc for her to discover this part of herself. So the emotional moments and beats all fall flat."

Sure, it had some differences compared to the original animated film, but in addition to being a more child-friendly version than the 1937 version that terrified them, it was a clear homage to the entire history of Disney production, since she was the first princess. In fact, there were references to every animated film and Disney movie, from Rapunzel to Sleeping Beauty, to Enchanted and Robin Hood. This movie was a version that clearly brought together all the Disney masterpieces, using Snow White as a tribute to all of them, since it was the first Disney film ever made. It was so obvious that all the criticisms about it being different left me speechless, it's obvious that it was, it was a tribute mixing all the characters and masterpieces, it could never have been the same! But they kept the same atmosphere of the forest, the dwarfs' house and the goodness of Snow White. The message was really sweet and true, I didn't find the costumes ugly at all as many said, in fact that red cape was beautiful! The songs were really nice and catchy, including some kept the same as the original... in short, for me it's an absolutely cute film and suitable for the whole family!"

I will say, I was very excited for this because of Rachel, and while she kills it, the movie as a whole does feel like it doesn't quite reach its potential. I actually thought Gal Gadot did a great job, and the CGI for the dwarves looked incredible, way better than I expected, so those aren't my complaints. I think it feels like maybe the pacing is off, and the hair and wardrobe are distracting. I think a rewatch may help though."

    "review": "While this film is structurally sound, it's lacking in the nuts and bolts of what truly makes a good film. I like the message they were going for, I even feel like it's one Walt would have personally endorsed; they just botched it completely at the end by showing that--surprise surprise--kindness did NOT, in fact, win in the end. Want to know what did win? The evil queen getting shot at by a crossbow. Less significant gripes include: -I personally don't like the designs of the Dwarves, but that's up to personal taste -While the songs are fairly high quality, they slow the pace of the film to a crawl -Snow White herself is a very unlikable character -Some of the acting is REALLY bad. Seriously, what the hell was up with Huntsman? Praise! -Most of the songs are really good! I especially like \"Fairest of Them All\" -I appreciate the innovation on the story even if it was fumbled a bit -Dopey's arc is a lot more compelling than I thought it would be Pound for pound, I'd recommend seeing this if you have nothing better to see. Don't go out of your way for it, but it's worth a watch."

Gal Gadot acting and singing was just horrible, and Andrew Burnap was worse than Gal Godot the dwarfs were terrifying I think I'm going to have nightmares for weeks but dopey was actually really scary like why did he look like that. It's really sad that they didn't give opportunity to people with dwarfism to be in a big film like this. The film over all was a mess and by the way they refilm this movie a second time and it still wasn't good. The costumes and makeup for snow white was pretty bad I just feel like if they gave her the right dress, hair and makeup it would have looked much better this film was like 99% CGI and I feel like the script was literally ai generated. When I watch this movie, it felt like it was 5 hours long, but it was only any hour and 39 minutes I literally wanted to die so I HIGHLY RECOMMED TO NOT WATCH THIS."

    "review": "Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúSnow White‚Äù ‚Äì A Woke Trainwreck That Misses the Magic Disney‚Äôs latest attempt to ‚Äúreimagine‚Äù Snow White is less of a fairy tale and more of a cautionary tale on how far Hollywood has fallen into the abyss of political correctness, identity politics, and woke ideology. What was once a timeless story about kindness, courage, and innocence has now been mutated into a hollow, preachy mess with little resemblance to the 1937 classic ‚Äî or the Brothers Grimm tale that inspired it. A Story No Longer About Snow White The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a whimsical tale centered around purity, jealousy, and triumph over evil. It celebrated femininity and traditional values without apology. In contrast, this new version ditches nearly everything that made the story resonate for nearly a century. Snow White, once a gentle-hearted character who found joy in small things and valued friendship and goodness, has now been rewritten into a hardened, independent rebel who ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need a prince‚Äù ‚Äî a painfully overused trope in modern remakes. Instead of letting the original character stand on her own merits, Disney decided to inject a forced feminist agenda that feels more like activism than storytelling. Wokeness Over Wonder From the casting choices to the rewritten dialogue, the entire movie seems like a checklist for woke credentials: Race-swapped protagonist: The lead role is played by an actress who openly criticized the original story in interviews before the movie even released. Rachel Zegler‚Äôs disdain for the source material is painfully obvious, and it‚Äôs hard to feel invested in a character when the actor seems embarrassed by the role. No dwarfs? Disney replaced the iconic seven dwarfs with a group of ‚Äúmagical beings‚Äù of different genders, races, and sizes ‚Äî completely erasing the characters that gave the original charm and humor. Ironically, this was done in the name of \"inclusion\" ‚Äî yet it wipes out roles for dwarf actors, the very people it claims to protect. Villainy gets softened: The Evil Queen, once a memorable and terrifying villain, is now more of a misunderstood character than a true threat. Once again, Disney seems afraid of portraying actual evil, opting instead for morally grey characters that push the idea that everyone‚Äôs just ‚Äúmisunderstood.‚Äù Bad for the Actors, Worse for the Legacy This film isn‚Äôt just a disservice to fans of classic Disney ‚Äî it‚Äôs a ticking time bomb for the actors involved. Rachel Zegler‚Äôs social media missteps and public comments criticizing the original film, princess tropes, and ‚Äúcringey romance‚Äù have already made her a controversial figure. For a young actress, alienating Disney fans is not a smart career move. Hollywood is learning ‚Äî slowly ‚Äî that pushing a forced agenda doesn‚Äôt guarantee success. Recent failures like The Marvels, Strange World, and Lightyear all tanked at the box office after audiences grew tired of being lectured. The same fate seems destined for Snow White, especially considering the backlash even before its release. Actors caught in the middle of these remakes are often blamed when it all falls apart, even when it‚Äôs the studio‚Äôs agenda driving the failure. Rather than lifting these actors up, these woke reboots are career anchors ‚Äî and Snow White is no exception. Hollywood‚Äôs Wokeness is Burning Out There‚Äôs a growing shift. Audiences are rejecting reboots that prioritize virtue signaling over storytelling. Independent films, faith-based content, and unapologetically traditional stories are thriving, while major studios continue to lose both viewers and respect. People don‚Äôt go to the movies to be scolded or to endure rewritten nostalgia with a side of politics. They want magic. They want heart. And Disney, once the master of wonder, seems to have lost the plot entirely. Conclusion: A Rotten Apple The new Snow White is a disastrous remake that strips away the soul of the original and replaces it with empty messaging and awkward reinvention. It‚Äôs not just inaccurate ‚Äî it‚Äôs disrespectful to the source material, to the fans, and ultimately to the actors who are now stuck defending a sinking ship. If you want to see Snow White, go back to the 1937 version ‚Äî the one that had heart, music, and meaning. This new version? It‚Äôs the mirror image of what made Disney great ‚Äî a reflection distorted by ideology, not imagination."

    "review": "Snow White has never been a favorite of mine, but coincidentally has always been a princess that I‚Äôve been compared to. Whether it for my short brunette hair, my love for nature and animals, or perhaps (even) my childlike spirit. I never connected with the story of Snow White because we have different backgrounds. She was known for her fair skin and delicate nature, which were two things I was not. Being mixed as always hard, because you never felt like you fit in anywhere. So when Rachel Zegler was announced to portray this iconic role in Disney‚Äôs live action remake, I was ecstatic. Zegler would not only be the first Latina cast as a Disney princess, but she was also mixed like me. Someone I have seen myself in before when she portrayed Maria in Stephen Speilberg‚Äôs West Side Story. I don‚Äôt need to tell you about the uproar of people against her when she was first cast. I think there are plenty of articles around the internet about that, including one by our own, Sarai Yanes, who covered that story wonderfully. I am here to give you my review, not only as a Disney lover, or as a mixed Puerto rican girl, but also as someone who was never into Snow White to begin with. I was excited to see Zegler portray this role and I wanted to support her work as our first Disney princess of Latin-descent, so I promptly saw the film opening day, Friday March 21st with my weekly AMC A-List ticket in hand. And I‚Äôll give you my thoughts with all of the spoilers: Key points: -Zegler was made to play Snow White (portrayed her well and spot on) -this reimagined version gave Snow, so much more courage and I enjoyed her back story as well as the necklace that she took with her from past to present (everyone is going to want one of those heart shaped necklaces now) -this movie was a MUSICAL and given that musicals aren‚Äôt for everyone. This movie was giving CAMP. It was over the top and almost cringey at points, but I feel like this was on purpose‚Äî It reminded me of broadway, it reminded me of Brandy‚Äôs Cinderella. Over the top, everyone was involved, which I wasn‚Äôt expecting. This felt different from other live action remakes. The whole town was singing, you recognized people who were not main characters. -theres been a lot of controversy also about Gal Gadot‚Äôs role in the movie, she is of Israeli descent and is Pro-Israel, so that‚Äôs been part of the controversy, but also for years people have talked about how she‚Äôs not a great actress but is awarded with these big blockbuster roles, where people are consistently disappointed in her performance. Personally, I don‚Äôt think she did great in this movie either. In simple terms, you just didn‚Äôt believe her. Her acting was too obvious, unbelievable, and you didn‚Äôt feel anything from the words she spoke. I would say, comparatively something like Maleficent for example was way more believable as a character. You could feel bad for her, even for Ursula in the little mermaid. She had a back story and you could believe where her revenge arch was coming from. This queen did not have that, along with a performance that frankly wasn‚Äôt believable for audiences. -Prince Charming was amazing. I love what they added to his character. He wasn‚Äôt actually a prince. She was genuinely someone you could fall for, comparatively to Prince Eric in the recent Little Mermaid live remake. It‚Äôs a great change for these ‚Äúprinces‚Äù to actually be activists and people who passions behind their courageous and ambitious spirits. His acting was truly believable and he had me falling for him too. -Something eerie about this remake was it felt like it came out at the perfect time, with everything we are going through under the new Administration in the United States. The movie flowed synonymously with the times. It portrayed a dystopian nation who was dealing with a greedy ruler and at least for me, it gave me that hope that as a community we probably do want the best for the greater good. This movie taught you that the ruler wants us to scramble and fight and be distracted with each other rather than help us prosper and that if we can work together, we can take our kingdom back for the betterment of everyone. I think this will be an inspiring film for the next generation. -It‚Äôs not a movie that is about being saved, it‚Äôs about having courage in the face of adversity and at a time where most people have lost hope. It inspires to continue fighting for what‚Äôs right, not matter the cost. In this movie, you saw great examples of people risking their lives for the hope of a better future. -Now let‚Äôs talk about the CGI dwarves, apparently the reason because the CGI dwarves version live action actors was to make sure they were not portraying little people in a negative light. I think that‚Äôs understandable. In the beginning, when you first meet the dwarves, it gives AI, it gives uncanny valley, but you eventually forget about their looks and are able to follow the characters in the story. It didn‚Äôt distract from the entire movie, like I think a lot of people are anticipating. -I think they did a great job at focusing on Grumpy and Dopey like they do in the original animated film. People will fall in love with Dopey all over again. I like that they eventually give him the courage to speak in this film. I think it brings great awareness to those who are non-verbal and it might even inspire some of those people. I think they wait for the perfect moment for him to finally speak from his heart and it is in the climax of the film, where he gives motivation to his peers during a difficult time in the film and pushes them to keep going. It‚Äôs a great example again for young children to learn something like that when they‚Äôre young. I made me think of kids on a playground watching someone get bullied and finally standing up to that bully. -Random thing: I don‚Äôt think the gems were believable. I think especially for the millennials and gen z who are going to see this film, like myself would‚Äôve loved to see them use real crystals and they don‚Äôt. You can tell the gems they‚Äôre using as fake or plastic and that would‚Äôve added again more believability to the story. Something I think would‚Äôve been portrayed differently in a film like Maleficent where we remember how real and luxurious and beautiful all of that looked. These ‚Äúuncut gems‚Äù if you will, do not aid Gadot‚Äôs role as it is. -I also heard people complaining about the costumes. I think the costumes were great, again giving a campy vibe, like Brandy‚Äôs Cinderella, super colorful. I really liked the remake of Snow White‚Äôs dress. She didn‚Äôt wear a bow, but had a cloak almost reminiscent of Red Riding Hood. And then it gets ripped off in her falling scene which reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. -Loved the artchictecure and detail that went into the cottage of the seven dwarves. It was beautiful, eclectic, timeless, and seemed comparable to things you can find in vintage shops. It perfectly portrayed the Germanic woodwork, as I collect some of those items in my own home. -All in all, I think it was a good movies, especially for the right person. Someone into broadway, musicals, campy dramatics. The only thing that brings the rating down for me was Gal Gadot‚Äôs performance. -I do not agree with Entertainment Weekly‚Äôs quote saying that it was Disneys BEST live action remake, however for Latinas and for Disney lovers I think you will all still enjoy this movie and the new takes on this classic film. I think more people will feel included in this story and it definitely gives a stronger and more inspirational message than the original."

Between Gal and Rachel, no matter which side you are on there are some problematic aspects that remove the viewer from the magic of escapism that is the reason why audiences see movies. Save your money and skip this one!"

I‚Äôm a moderate, which feels weird to state for a movie rating, but the movie itself was great and had nothing to do with politics in my opinion! Beautiful songs, cinematography, story, themes (embellished from original animated movie but personally I think the original could have had more depth and use of source material). My 2.5 year old daughter was captivated the whole time. Disney did a great job (I haven‚Äôt seen their other live action remakes to compare)!"
